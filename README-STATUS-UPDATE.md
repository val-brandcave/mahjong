## 💬 Questions Answered

**Q: Is the app done?**
A: No. Phase 1 (foundation) is complete. Phase 2-5 remain (lessons, challenges, backend, polish).

**Q: Can I show this to users?**
A: Yes! Show instructors (Genny & Rebekah) the onboarding flow for feedback. Not ready for public beta yet.

**Q: How long until launch?**
A: 6-8 weeks if Phase 2 starts this week. (App store: December 2025 or January 2026)

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: Content creation (lessons & challenges). Everything else is designed but need Genny & Rebekah's expertise.

**Q: Do we need to hire more developers?**
A: Recommended: +1 backend engineer, +1 junior frontend developer. Cody can't do all this alone.

**Q: How much does this cost to build?**
A: Backend infrastructure ~$100/month. Additional devs ~$60k (3 months). Typical MVP: $20-30k total.

**Q: What about payment processing?**
