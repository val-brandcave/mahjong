00:07 mahjong set thank you to Yellow Mountain
00:10 Imports for providing the Mahjong set
00:12 used in this video
00:15 for American Mahjong there are 152 tiles
00:19 used there are three different suits the

00:33 tiles and Joker tiles each player is
00:37 given a rack all the tiles are shuffled
00:40 face down in the middle of the playing
00:42 area each player will then create a line
00:44 of 19 tiles stack two tiles High
00:49 each player stack is pushed to the
00:51 middle to form the wall a dealer needs
00:54 to be assigned for the first game this
00:56 is done by each player taking a turn at
00:58 rolling two dice the player that rolls
01:01 the highest amount is the first dealer
01:03 here yellow becomes the first dealer and
01:05 is known as East the dealer will break
01:08 the wall by Rolling the two dice again
01:10 the dealer will count off the amount
01:12 rolled from the stack of tiles in front
01:15 of them from right to left and will
01:17 separate the tiles at that point the
01:20 dealer will take the first two stacks of
01:22 tiles to the left of the break play Then
01:25 moves right with each player in turn
01:27 taking the next four tiles
01:30 this is done three times by each player
01:33 to get a total of 12 tiles then yellow
01:37 as East will take the first and third
01:40 tiles on the top row and moving
01:42 counterclockwise the other players will
01:44 take one tile from the end this gives
01:47 the dealer 14 tiles and every other
01:50 Player 13 tiles to start
01:54 the object of the game is to be the
01:56 first player to get Mahjong mahjong is a
01:59 specific combination of 14 tiles here
02:02 are some examples of winning
02:03 combinations there are many combinations
02:06 that can win and each year the national
02:08 Mahjong League comes out with a
02:11 scorecard of all the possible winning
02:13 combinations trying to decide what
02:16 combination to go for can be
02:17 overwhelming to new players but the more
02:20 you play the more familiar you will
02:22 become with a scorecard most winning
02:25 combinations involve getting some
02:27 combination of pairs three of a kind
02:29 four of a kind five of a kind or six of
02:33 a Kind The Jokers can be used as a
02:36 substitute for any tile in a three of a
02:39 kind four of a kind five of a kind or
02:42 six of a kind
02:44 the game starts with the Charleston this
02:48 is an exchange of tiles to help players
02:50 improve their hands by passing unwanted
02:53 tiles to other players the Charleston
02:56 starts with each player selecting three
02:58 tiles to pass these tiles are placed
03:00 face down in the playing area the first
03:03 pass is to the right the players will
03:05 take in the new tiles then the process
03:08 is repeated in total there can be up to
03:11 seven rounds of tile exchanges the first
03:14 pass that was just shown is to the right
03:16 the next pass is to the opposite player
03:19 the third pass is to the left at this
03:22 point if all players agree that
03:24 Charleston will continue but if a player
03:27 is satisfied with their hand they can
03:30 end the Charleston if the Charleston
03:32 continues the fourth passes to the left
03:34 the fifth pass is to the opposite player
03:37 the sixth pass is to the right the
03:40 acronym roller can be used to remember
03:42 the order of passing I after the sixth
03:45 pass players sitting opposite each other
03:48 can make one more exchange of up to
03:50 three tiles if agreed upon Jokers can
03:53 never be passed the dealer starts the
03:56 drawing and discarding phase of the
03:58 round since the dealer has 14 tiles this
04:02 phase is started by the dealer
04:03 discarding one tile to the middle
04:06 playing area a discarded tile can be
04:08 claimed by another player and this is
04:11 known as the tile being called if the
04:14 discard tile is not called play moves to
04:17 the right to the next player here blue
04:20 starts their turn by drawing the next
04:22 tile from the wall blue will then decide
04:24 on one tile to discard Play Moves right
04:27 and players will continue to take turns
04:29 drawing and discarding tiles
04:33 as mentioned the most recent tile to be
04:37 discarded can be called by any player in
04:40 order to call a tile the called tile
04:43 must complete a three of a kind four of
04:45 a kind five of a kind or six of a Kind
04:48 for the calling player when the
04:51 discarding tile is brought in by a
04:53 player the completed combination is
04:55 exposed for all other players to see
04:58 this player will then discard one tile
05:00 and play continues with the next player
05:03 on the right this means that some
05:05 players may have their turn skipped when
05:08 a tile is called additional rules around
05:10 calling a tile will be covered in the
05:13 rules section of this video
05:16 when a player creates a winning
05:18 combination mahjong is declared the
05:21 winning player receives a payout from
05:23 all other players based on the winning
05:25 hand combination the payout amounts are
05:29 listed next to the winning hands in the
05:31 scorecard
05:33 there are two types of winning hands
05:35 listed in the scorecard exposed and
05:38 concealed if a player is going for a
05:40 concealed hand to win all tiles must be
05:43 drawn from the wall as calling a tile
05:46 requires a player to expose the
05:49 combination the exception to this rule
05:51 is if the called tile is the last tile
05:54 needed to complete a mahjong hand a tile
05:57 cannot be called to complete a pair
05:60 unless it completes a mahjong hand if
06:03 two or more players call for the same
06:05 tile it will go to the player that can
06:08 use it to complete a mahjong hand first
06:10 if the tile does not complete a mahjong
06:13 hand for any player the tile goes to the
06:16 player nearest in turn tiles discarded
06:19 prior to the most recent one cannot be
06:22 called they are considered dead tiles
06:24 Jokers cannot be used to complete a pair
06:28 or as a single tile in a hand if a
06:32 player gets a tile for a combination
06:33 that is currently using a joker in an
06:36 exposed combination the actual tile can
06:39 be substituted for the Joker and the
06:42 Joker is returned to the player's hand
06:44 if all the tiles have been drawn from
06:46 the wall and no player has announced
06:49 Mahjong the game ends in a draw after a
06:52 game the player right of the dealer
06:55 becomes the new dealer for the next game
