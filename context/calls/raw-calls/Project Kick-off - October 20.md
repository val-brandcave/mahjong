# **Project Kick-off \- October 20**

[**VIEW RECORDING \- 86 mins (No highlights)**](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD)

[@0:00](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=0.0) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

But do you know what AWS is? No. AWS is Amazon Web Services. It's basically the service that is the server for like most of the internet.

So like, you know, anything that's not Google or Microsoft basically runs on AWS for the most part. And it's down today.

So all of us who like run software companies are like, I'm shitting our pants a little bit today. Oh, I did see that on the face this morning.

[@0:33](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=33.0) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Oh, yeah. But I didn't know about AWS. didn't know. Amazon Web Services. I mean, are my Amazon packages going to make it today?

[@0:41](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=41.92) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, Amazon runs on AWS. So I need that paint sprayer.

[@0:49](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=49.04) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Oh, no.

[@0:49](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=49.8) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So, yeah, like Snapchat and, you know, Loom and a bunch of like the Starbucks app was down this morning, you know.

[@0:59](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=59.5) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Oh. It's kind of scary to think of everything's like in that little. Right. No, it's very scary. Well, it's very scary.

Like when a cell phone provider goes down, you know, and you're like, we don't have landlines. we're like, what do you mean the cell phone goes down?

[@1:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=75.652) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, it's all, you know, so for software companies, it's all so convenient just to, hey, you know, Amazon has all this extra capacity.

Let's just rent it from them. It's cheaper and, you know, not really cheaper, but everyone thinks it is. And it's easy.

Let's just plug in. Right. And then they have a little oops. And the rest of us go down and go, maybe we shouldn't have put all of the internet on that server in Ohio.

[@1:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=100.692) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That's scary.

[@1:42](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=102.372) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah. Well, I'm so excited to kick this off. This is going to be such a fun project and we're going to kick a lot of together.

So thanks for trusting me.

[@1:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=111.872) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

We're excited. Do you mind?

[@1:54](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=114.892) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I just want to start at the very, very beginning and like, let's pretend we've never talked before. Sure. And I'm recording this call.

It's going to be a really important call for us just as I build these context documents. What the future looks like for me is I need to step into your world.

I need to understand this game, the players in it, the world around it, the world building. And then I'm going to create a bunch of context documents.

And then I'm going to, once I understand the world better and what you're trying to do in it, I'm going to create what's called an entity relationship blueprint, basically a little high-level model of the database.

And then once I have that, I'm going to map out what's called the information architecture. And basically what is the, you have a sign-in page and when the user signs in, what's the next thing they see?

And, you know, is there gamification in there? All those different features. And then once I have that, what I'm going to attempt to do, I do this on most projects today, but yours might be really hard to do it on.

I'm going to attempt to build a AI proof of concept. So I'm literally going to create like a little clickable prototype within this discovery scope.

And because it's a... Game and there might be some 3D elements in there that might not work so well.

If it doesn't, I'm going to fall back to my traditional process of just doing a flowchart and then we're going to design it out properly.

Either way, we're going to design it out properly, but it'd be really cool to have like a little AI prototype that we can play around with and really kind of get the sense of how this thing works.

So that's my goal. Any questions prior to diving in?

[@3:23](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=203.876) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

No, we did find a, and this might be like, just tell us when it's time to tell you about this, but I did find a chess game online that is like very, like the flow was very simple and user friendly.

And we really liked how it just, there just wasn't like so much going on, you know, it was easy to get to play the game.

It was easy to navigate if you want practice, it was easy, you know, so what was the name of that chess game?

[@3:57](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=237.256) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So it's, it's an app.

[@3:58](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=238.416) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

It's chess, chess.com. Cool.

[@4:05](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=245.648) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

What were the things you liked about it? The simplicity.

[@4:09](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=249.968) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I'm going to go into it now. So when you first open the app, I don't know if you can see from there.

Oh, no, it's not going to show up. It's glowing. Just the simplicity, when you go in, it gives you the options to, like, for example, there's this solve puzzles, daily puzzle, play with bots, play with coach.

Or you can do a lesson. So it's very, like, user-friendly, very simple. Like, it's big. It's, like, big, you know, it's not, like, tiny line items of, like, you know, you have to really, like, think about what you're doing.

It's just, like, five big icons, you know, like. Yeah, cool. How do they make money?

[@4:47](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=287.308) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

What's their model?

[@4:49](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=289.228) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So when you click on play, okay, so when you click on play, you can go to start game. It gives you the option to just play as a guest or an option to sign up.

can on on on on you can click I know. Let's see. I haven't gone into like cost yet. I was trying to see if it gives me the option here.

It was free to download. Yeah. So I haven't played around with cost yet on like what they're. I'm sure you could play as a guest like a couple times or something and then it'll say.

I'll have to get back to you on that part. Sure. Because I'll have to create an account and stuff.

But I'd like the the simplicity of being actually like start a game like you could just go in there and start a game and then it gives you the option.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Cody Chess.com screenshots w/ notes \+ Oh My Mahjong site link \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=325.9999)**

you new to chess, beginner, intermediate, advanced and so on. And that might be something later on I can give you like a extra screenshot, you know, some of the pages and make little notes of like, OK, we like this.

Yeah. Yeah. That'd be perfect. Yeah.

[@5:46](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=346.88) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So in our world here, that would be called a design reference.

[@5:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=350.68) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Right.

[@5:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=350.96) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So if you and I are being creative in this endeavor, we're normally doing it wrong. Right. Because this is software and people have built this a thousand times.

And we just need to emulate what people are doing right. And that way we make less mistakes overall. So design references like that are huge.

[@6:08](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=368.072) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay. Sweet. One thing, sorry. No, please. This just popped into my head. One thing on that app, it has an option to where you can change the backgrounds and stuff.

And I feel like that could be a moneymaker if we partnered with one of the major Mahjong brands and be like, you know, we could use their designs as the background or their maps.

Yeah. And that would be like advertisement for them, essentially. Anyways, you know, it'd say like, oh, my Mahjong everywhere or at the bottom of the mat or whatever, you know.

Anyways, just a thought. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[@6:44](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=404.712) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Good idea. Not your MVP.

[@6:48](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=408.392) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

What'd you say? Not your MVP, but a really good idea. Do you know what I mean by MVP? Say that again.

Sorry.

[@6:56](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=416.112) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

MVP is a minimal viable product. So you're going to hear me say this word a lot. Like what we're looking for is the least amount of things we need to do to make money.

So partnering with brands, that's a V1.5 or a V2, right? Because we don't need it in order to start making money as a company.

Gotcha. So you'll hear me push back a little bit like that.

[@7:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=435.164) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Well, so you probably will because I'm a creative brain and, you know, I like the bright colors and the look and everything.

And so we probably, you just chill out. You got to tell us like, you don't have that kind of money right now.

Like, calm down. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I need you guys to make money so you can keep working with me.

That's all. So we basically need the generic version and then we can add the fluff later.

[@7:36](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=456.644) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, I mean, in terms of like the look and feel and the design, like all those things can be part of the MVP.

What really we mean by the MVP is like, what are the functional features that are required? Like just throwing some things out here and I haven't thought about this whatsoever, but like, do we need to be able to play online with other users as part of the MVP or can we just play against bots, right?

Those are decisions we need to make that say version one. things most fun in We're Fathom has to have this in order for us to go live, right?

[@8:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=486.476) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

See, and I think that now finding this app, I think it could start out as just bots and, you know, a tutorial and stuff starting out.

Oh, I agree. I know in some of the Mahjong groups, I see a lot of people asking like, hey, I just joined Mahj with friends.

Is anybody, does anybody else want to hop on the game or, you know, stuff like that? Yeah, but if we, if that needs to be, you know, our second version or whatever, then that's fine.

I mean, I don't really care. But I think, like you said, we need to get the functionality first of like, you know, what is our main things we want in that first?

Yeah, I agree. Yeah, yeah.

[@8:42](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=522.276) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And we don't have to have it all figured out right now, but we're going to work through that, right, as we're doing this.

And you guys are going to discover you have very strong opinions about things, and that'll just be the business decision that you guys have to make, right?

Okay, so let's start just at the very basic level here. Who are the people who... Play Mahjong. And the technical word here is our user personas, right?

And there's going to be more than one, right? There's going to be probably that expert Mahjong player who plays it in their free time.

There's going to be that person who's brand new to the game. But we need to put some characteristics. Like if we were to meet that person at the bar or wherever you meet people who play Mahjong, like what do they look like?

What do they do for a living? What's their, you know, are they like savvy with technology? Are they not?

You know, are they female or male?

[@9:33](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=573.088) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Immediately, I can break it down into three people, like three different user personas. There is like the old school, like, I would say like 60 plus year old female who's been playing for 30 years.

And those are the people who are like very like particular about. Mahjong, who were very strict about all the rules, who were very by the book.

They want to play everything by the book. And in terms of being savvy, it would need to be very user-friendly and simple for them.

The second one is going to be, Cody, don't know how old you are, but I feel like our mom's age-ish.

And these aren't going to be the, they're kind of going to be the same age as the other ones, like 60s, 50s maybe.

But they're going to be new to Mahjong, but they're like the Bunko crowd. Okay, so they're coming from Bunko and they're now trying out Mahjong.

Now they're kind of switching over. So it's like they kind of, and they're like kind of like the Bunko Pickleball moms.

Yeah. It's like they hopped on Pickleball when it was cool and now they're hopping on Mahjong because it's cool.

And I feel like also the same, like probably has to be pretty simple. For them. then we have like the trendy young crowd.

And this ranges like I would say college to young moms. And it's big with that crowd, I think. Like, I mean, I know several young girls, college to like 25, who are just obsessed.

And they love to spend money on it. They love the cutesy style aspect of it. All female. There is not going to be men downloading this app.

Yeah, I agree. Wow.

[@11:35](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=695.592) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

That's a really strong statement. Men don't play Mahjong?

[@11:39](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=699.212) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Only if their wives play and their wives force them to play at home. Like my husband. Not to say that it couldn't, because my husband's a chess guy.

he actually. My husband is a poker guy and he loves it. Yeah, but. And not to, but then again, I feel like this app could eventually, I feel like my husband could download it and play it on the toilet just to.

Learn how to play Mahjong as well. I do not think that's our user persona. Right. The men, yeah. Yeah.

The men on the toilet. Got it. Totally.

[@12:10](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=730.104) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

You mentioned three different groups. The first two are fairly similar to each other. They're older, maybe less savvy with technology.

But that college to young moms, if you had to prioritize, which one of these does this app need to serve more than all the other user personas?

like the older crowd.

[@12:31](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=751.724) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah. I feel like that's a larger crowd. Which one? Persona one, two, or two? I would say two, honestly.

The pickleball mom, like the 50s to 70-year-old. I feel like, I mean, like my mom will straight up ignore everything that's happening in her life to stare at Candy Crush.

[@12:58](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=778.304) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah. And I feel like that.

[@12:59](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=779.704) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Me Me Yeah. I'm That's like the, like, that's the person who's going to download this and play it. Yeah, because we have, and this is something too from us, you know, being instructors of ladies that they want to learn, but they don't, they, you know, they come to our lessons, but then they want to be able to get better at home.

And then they're addicted to this game and they want to be able to, you know, still feed that and get better and be able to play with their girlfriends and beat them, you know?

So I feel like I would say 40 to 70\. Yeah. It's a good range. I mean, we're 40s. We're 40s.

So it's like, I would, I mean, I'm not like a phone game person, but I would probably do it on the couch while I'm watching Landman or something.

I don't know. feel like it has to have that, it has to have a traditional aspect, obviously still with our vibe to it, but, but also that with the option to change your themes or to have that kind of updated look.

Yeah. Yeah. Does that give you kind of enough? Yeah, I think I'm learning a lot here.

[@13:58](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=838.896) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So if I could. Put a name to the user persona. I'm calling this the Pickleball Mom. That's exactly what it is.

[@14:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=846.368) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

The Pickleball Mom.

[@14:08](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=848.608) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay. I mean, can you picture that persona in your head?

[@14:12](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=852.228) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Do you know who you're talking about?

[@14:14](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=854.528) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

You know, another way I would describe this is like the Candy Crush Mom, who is absolutely my mom, right?

And probably has spent an ungodly amount of money on Candy Crush, right? She doesn't play Pickleball, but I get it.

She's not tech savvy. She has a lot of free time. She's an empty nester, right? In late nights, when she's watching her shows, she also has Candy Crush on, easily replaced by this app.

I get it.

[@14:44](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=884.728) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, that's exactly who it is.

[@14:47](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=887.268) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay. So we're looking at an audience that we need to have some oversized buttons on, if you know what I'm saying.

We should probably take a lot of design references from Candy Crush. Candy really great example of an incredibly addictive game, and probably need to look at them from a monetization standpoint as well, because I don't play Candy Crush, but I'm pretty sure they do ads within the app.

[@15:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=916.32) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I think they do too. For design reference, just kind of a vibe to look at, you might want to peruse the Oh My Mahjong website.

And that is like a very good example, I feel like, of what people want. Every time, you know, we have a ton of Oh My Mahjong stuff, and that's kind of what, every time we have a class, which is freaking every day, it feels like.

That's what people are like, oh my gosh, we just love this stuff, and it's expensive, you know? So, just like the bright colors, the pretty patterns, they commission artists to make all of their, you know, mats that they do with these pretty designs.,ありがとうございました.

Thank And so I just feel like that's the like colorful, kind of elevated vibe that we like. set us apart from these other.

Yeah. Move on, move on. Yeah.

[@16:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=975.752) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

If you were, this might be a little hard because when we think of games, we don't think of problems.

But if you were to define the business problem that this app is going to solve, what would you say that problem is?

[@16:27](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=987.792) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Simplicity? Well, no, I specifically think that the problem that we're solving with this app is that they pay us, whatever, 60 bucks to come to a class.

They leave that class and they don't know how to play Mahjong because it's so nuanced and complicated. So if we were able to create an app and say, when they leave our class, go download this app.

And there's ways to practice by yourself instead of having to pay another $60 to come to another class. And basically, we don't have enough time to do the appropriate kinds of classes that people

We'll need after they've taken a beginner class. Like we're so inundated with just beginner classes that people are just keep coming to beginner classes over and over again until they know what they're doing.

Whereas they could just download this app and practice with bots or do like the Charleston practice if we add that to our app.

And then maybe you only have to come back once, you know, and kind of know what's going on. Or, you know, I feel like and we always tell them at the classes, you're going to need to take more than one class.

Whereas if they, if they were able to practice on the app, it feels like. Yeah, I feel like in our app, compared to some of the other apps that I had put in our little presentation is they are so confusing and so many, there's a lot of words.

It's like, if you go to help on app, you then have to read this article of how to even, how to play the game or how to even use the app.

I feel like chess.com, if you get a chance later to look at it, the way they do their tutorial or their tips is very easy to read.

So I feel like. Our app needs to have that aspect of... Yeah, or even if like the tutorial, like a little like thought bubble would come up or something, you know, and saying like, and now we pass to the right, you know, and then another, you know, just, I don't know.

[@18:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1096.0) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Let's not try to solve for that so much because there are tons of like UX patterns for teaching users how to do things, not just by saying like tooltip and do this now.

It's usually that combined with like, you have to do this. Like I'm actually physically leading you through this. And in order for us to move the next step, you have to drag this from here to here.

[@18:33](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1113.84) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah.

[@18:34](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1114.2) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So those kinds of things we're going to solve for once I understand your world a little bit better. Yeah.

[@18:38](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1118.74) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay.

[@18:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1120.28) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay. So let's, let's, let's state the problem statement just a little bit more succinctly. Mahjong is a nuanced and complicated game.

This app dot, dot, dot.

[@18:53](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1133.08) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Like you're saying, just make it like basically what the problem solving is. Finish the problem statement. Okay. Okay. I think this app will allow practice outside of the first lesson to be able to play independently without having to take several lessons.

Or what do you think? Yeah, sorry. I'm not good with Bob Pitt. I'm put on the spot. Oh, that's okay.

But yeah, I feel like we want to streamline, let's see. Streamline the learning process. learn Mahjong. I mean, feel like, because we want to, I'm doing, I'm not giving you like a sentence.

Yeah, it doesn't sound like. But it's. Yeah, that's okay. To be able to, A, people to be able to just jump on and play, but then also for beginners that want to learn how to play.

feel like it's. Become more confident in playing. For beginners to become more confident in playing. Mm-hmm. But I can get you a like legitimate intro like description.

[@19:52](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1192.99) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

if think about it, there's, you don't have to have this solidified. We're just, we're just talking. But if you, if you think about it more and you go, okay, this is actually, this is the problem.

Follow the statement. Feel free. Send it over.

[@20:02](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1202.54) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay.

[@20:04](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1204.22) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

But, you know, ultimately, it allows players to become more confident in playing Mahjong.

[@20:09](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1209.26) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, for sure. Yes. Yes. Easy to follow.

[@20:14](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1214.5) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Cool. And then if you could kind of distill the solution statement, you know, what would be, how do you plan on solving that problem?

[@20:27](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1227.0) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

With a clear and simple, a clear and simple step-by-step tutorials, and then with, you know, practice on the app.

I know if you'll just send us these questions. I feel like we should have done our homework. It's totally okay.

You don't need to be prepared for anything here. We're working through it. I do feel like that's what we're hoping that this app will have for people.

I mean, I do hope that there is like a social. And maybe that's like you're saying, not the MVP, where they can, you know, words with friends that, you know, but I think that initially, I want our app to be user-friendly enough, clear enough, easy enough for beginners to understand to where it's like, it becomes the go-to app.

I mean, on our Instagram account, I bet we follow, I don't know, 200 Mahjong instructors who are doing the same thing that we're doing all over the country.

And I would like for it to become a resource for these teachers to say, okay, you've gotten the basics through this beginner class.

Like, when we have classes, we recommend I Love Mahj. That's the- Thank you. It's not an app, but the website we recommend to people to go to.

And I would like for us to be a resource that instructors can recommend. This is a clear tutorial on how to continue the knowledge that you have.

[@22:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1336.86) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

It's just a place to practice in between maybe lessons or...

[@22:20](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1340.5) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, or gameplay with other friends or whatever. Yeah, and then it could turn into eventually... build your confidence so that you don't...

I mean, people get so nervous when... I know you don't know, but the dealing process in Mahjong is very nuanced and it's very weird and complicated.

And people get so on the spot, like nervous when you say, okay, you're the dealer. And they're just like, ah, you know, like, we can't do that.

I don't know how to do that, you know? And so that is one of the things that I would like to have like a specific focus on in the app.

It's called the Charleston. So people can not feel so like scared of it. Intiminated. Intiminated. Yeah. Is the Charleston just a strategy for how to play?

So the Charleston is a series of tile passes you do before you start the game. It's like part of the dealing process.

Okay. It's like very, it's like very long. Like when you're teaching a class, it's like 30 minutes of dealing the first game, you know, and it's like, people get like, what was that when it's done?

yeah. And then it's like, you pass your first three tiles to the right. The next pass is, is across.

And then you go to the left and there's like all these little, there's a courtesy pass. And then they're, you know, and so people are just like, you know, it's a lot.

You're just learning. It takes a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

[@23:34](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1414.3) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Is that, is the Charleston something, is there different game modes, like different ways to play? And is the Charleston just one of them?

[@23:43](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1423.64) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So, so in our class, so National Mahjong League, I think we mentioned our first call. So we teach National Mahjong League rules.

So we were teaching these ladies that if they were to eventually go play for a league or in a tournament, they're playing by the exact rules.

Now there's then house. rules in other ways, which is like messy Mahjong, which you don't do the Charleston. There's a couple other versions that aren't National Mahjong League.

So I think those are things that we can incorporate later if people wanted to play, you know, by house rules or whatever.

But I feel like our app is going to have to be more just National Mahjong League. Yes. In the beginning.

Yeah. Okay.

[@24:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1464.57) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So we make this incredibly easy on ourselves where there's only one game mode and it's the National Mahjong rule.

And when you play, you do the Charleston. Is that true? Yes.

[@24:35](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1475.29) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I think that you can have the option to do one or two. Yes. Yes. In our little presentation, we had sent you that little PowerPoint.

I have it broken down in there, like from the goal of Mahjong to the tiles, the walls, the Charleston.

kind of gives you a little bit of a gist of how the game flows. Okay. But we can break it down further for you for sure.

Yeah, I would love to come to one of your next events and just watch.

[@25:07](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1507.2) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

We have a lot coming up.

[@25:09](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1509.08) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay. When's the next one? You can just come over one day and we'll give you a lesson. Oh, well, the next one's tonight, Burn It.

Okay. Is it really? Yeah. That's funny. Okay. No, but we have several coming up. Where is our next one?

Let's see. We've got Burn It and then we've got Private and then Crystal Falls will be at Cork and Barrel and Leander.

Oh, that's next week. Yeah. then, you know, I love Cork and Barrel and Leander.

[@25:38](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1538.36) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

The one in our list. Oh, well, have you been there? No one goes to it.

[@25:44](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1544.34) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Well, I don't really understand exactly what happened. Maybe it just got bought and it's going to open back up as Cork and Barrel.

But a different. Yeah. Okay. Now it's called Cork and Barrel on the greens on the golf course in Crystal Falls.

Yeah. It is so far away. Hey, we could even do like legit meet. We'll meet you and your wife.

Me and Jenny will meet you and your wife and we'll have four people. Yeah, we can just play. It's very easy.

I mean, it would be very like laid back. I feel it would be faster too. It would be much faster for you than having to sit with these screaming women.

It gets wild. Okay, cool.

[@26:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1584.11) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Love to do that. So let's plan for it. I'll be in Florida for the rest of the week after today.

[@26:30](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1590.83) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

But maybe like next week.

[@26:32](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1592.43) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I'll be in Orlando.

[@26:34](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1594.91) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah. What are you doing there? Are you going to Disney? I am not.

[@26:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1600.23) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

We have a software company called Ashore and there's a big, it's mostly used by printers and there's a big print conference that happens every year there.

So just a trade show thing.

[@26:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1610.37) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

My daughter told me this morning that she does, she's set at six and she told me she does not like Mickey Mouse anymore or Minnie Mouse.

And I said, well, that must mean you don't want to go to Disney. She said, well, I still want to go to Disney.

I just do not want to see Mickey. I There are many, and I go, I don't know. That is so funny.

I don't really know if I'm going to spend the money to go there. This is what we're working with here.

[@27:12](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1632.42) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay, so the game mode that, so for our MVP, the game mode we're going to support, no matter what, is the National Mahjong Rules.

[@27:19](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1639.6) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah.

[@27:20](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1640.12) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

If I could describe the solution, what I'm hearing is like, this is the Mahjong instructor in an app. So, maybe if all our MVP was, was like, here are some different practices and a practice mode or a game mode that teaches you.

Maybe with just the ability to play against a bot as well, like, that's a pretty good MVP. Let me pull it back further and test these waters, though.

Playing against a bot is not playing against AI, but playing against an artificial intelligence, not like proper generative AI.

But that is not little work. What would it look like if all this app did? It was just to practice rounds and just literally taught you some different techniques.

Is that enough for an MVP? Is that not enough? Do we need the ability of doing practice games, like full practice games without instruction?

[@28:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1696.5) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I feel like it would. Yeah, I think it does. I mean, what if we just take away the bots and we say it's only play with, like, whoever's online?

[@28:27](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1707.6) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Then it wouldn't really be able to do again.

[@28:29](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1709.42) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah. There's complication there, too.

[@28:32](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1712.22) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

What we would need to do is pull in someone a little bit more technical to say, actually, it's less work to do a bot than it is to play online or vice versa.

Okay.

[@28:42](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1722.0) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So let me make a note of that. I feel like you would have to have, this is my opinion, like, we would have to have the bots.

I'm thinking of ilovemoj.com, and when we play on there, like, majority of the time I play with bots because I don't want to wait for a live person to come on, right?

And so I feel like I get the most practice when I'm playing with a bot. So And they're hard to play with because they always win.

I know, but they do have, so on the bots, they do have where you can play with, you know, different, I guess, three different levels.

You can, you know, be easy, intermediate, or hard.

[@29:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1755.85) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, if we're going at practice games, I kind of feel like you have to have a bot no matter what, because at least when you first launch, right, and you don't have people playing at all times, right?

You could be sitting in some sort of waiting state, waiting for another player to join for hours, right? So until you get some virality behind the app, you probably should only have playing against bots.

Yeah, of course. Yeah. Okay. But we need to kind of do a technical assessment of, like, how difficult is it to actually add in a bot that can properly play at different modes.

[@29:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1790.25) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay. Okay.

[@30:00](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1800.79) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah. Yeah. And it would be like a much easier MVP to not have playing against a bot whatsoever and instead just add lessons.

But that'd be also not as fun. Right.

[@30:14](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1814.68) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

But we could see like, because I feel like right now, like our story, feel like would be like, okay, this app was created by Mahjong instructors who needed, you know, needed a solution to help their students get better at playing Mahjong, right?

Like, so I think we could also, you know, figure out, okay, if we went that path, right, if we went that path where it is mainly just a tutorial at first, okay, what does that cost?

What does that timeline look like if we were to just stay within that lane? And then keep behind the scenes, be working on, like, next, yeah, if we did, you know, get route with actual gameplay and everything else.

Yeah.-hmm. Yeah. So do you feel like it's a solution? It's a solution to these ladies who are like, yeah, what's next?

Yeah. And then they'll wait like a month to take a class and they've literally forgot every single thing, you know?

Yeah.

[@31:08](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1868.05) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

The real question is, if all this app did was kind of take you through different lessons and have you kind of simulate playing, is that enough to pay for?

[@31:20](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1880.31) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Like, what, in your downloads?

[@31:23](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1883.35) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, I mean, so either you charge that one-time cost up front or you get them into some sort of monthly subscription, right?

In either of those cases, would someone pay in order to not play online against other players or even against a bot, but just to do those lessons?

I feel like they would.

[@31:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1900.57) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I feel like there's a market for it for certain ladies. It would definitely be like they would use it just for, you know, like a month or two and they would probably not need it anymore, right?

But it depends. It's like, for example, like the Charleston. The Charleston is hard for beginners to comprehend and like figure out what they need to pass and hold on to.

That I feel like there would be ladies that. Would use it longer just to, you know, have the practice, you know, have that in their back pocket to practice.

There is another app that has, what was it? What did they call it? Where you could basically put in like what tiles you have in your rack.

And it would guide you. Yeah, it helps you pick up. That's like cheating. I know it is. That's like cheating.

Okay, we're not going to add that. Yeah. Okay. So I think the answer is yes. Yes, I think it could, but I don't know how long users would actually pay for it if that makes sense.

Yeah, I don't know that it would.

[@32:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1960.58) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, certainly, I mean, if we think about this as an MVP, is that enough for us to launch and start making money?

That's a good place to think. And then post MVP, you know, what does it look like from a technical implementation standpoint?

And like literally add in playing against a bot at different skill levels. And we'll, you know, when we find our technical partner for this.

And that'll be some of the things they help us decide.

[@33:04](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1984.92) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay.

[@33:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=1986.8) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And this is, I think I told you, my office is in a house, so we just like, don't tell the HOA.

Downstairs, there's a dev agency with a guy who's done some video game work. I'll just kind of ask him, you know, what that looks like and what's really the delta between playing against other players versus playing a bot, what's easier, you know.

[@33:25](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2005.6) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Okay. Okay.

[@33:29](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2009.52) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay, let's set some goals then for the MVP, just at a high level. These are business goals, right? Like, what would success look like for you?

[@33:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2020.74) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, it's probably monetary, truly. Yeah, absolutely. But we are in business to make money. Yeah.

[@33:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2030.32) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So let me kind of frame this in a way where you can kind of use that as a pattern.

Within six months of launch, we have X amount of players who are paying. mean... $4 a month, right? Or whatever that looks like.

Let's put some success criteria around the app, more than just from a feature standpoint.

[@34:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2055.91) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Well, I don't know if we know exactly the best way to monetize it at this point, right? I mean, I don't know if it's going to be a monthly fee, advertisements in the app, or do you do all of this?

Yeah. And then, like, I think that also the number of, so for us, it's going to be, I think our main, or at least for me, we haven't really talked about this, but I think the main concern would be obviously, like, getting our initial investment back, right?

Like, that's going to be, you know, for me, as long as we get that back, then the rest is just, like, that's fine.

You know, like it's fun. It's not, we're both saving moms. We're blessed that we don't have to, you know, financially, you know, contribute.

Yeah. You know, so it's like, it's not like we got to be making $10,000 a month, you know, it's like, we just want to make our investment back.

then like, hopefully, I mean, hopefully we're like the next Candy Crush, right? Like that would be so cool. Yeah.

Yeah. We're not going to set the goals.

[@35:31](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2131.46) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

mean, so let's just put some kind of pretend magic numbers on this for a moment. Let's say you spend $30,000 on your MVP.

Okay. Not an unreasonable amount of money, especially for a mobile app. Sure. You go to market, you promote it locally, obviously, within your network, on social, organically, within your classes.

That gets you to maybe a certain amount of subscribers. Let's say, I don't know, put a number to it.

Just magic number for a moment. I don't know.

[@36:03](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2163.63) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

A thousand.

[@36:04](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2164.87) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

A thousand. Okay.

[@36:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2166.93) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

A thousand.

[@36:09](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2169.29) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Do you think you could do that organically? Just within your classes and your network? I think so.

[@36:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2175.89) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, we've taught, what, six, seven hundred ladies since February? Yeah, but all of them aren't going to. But we could also, like, I was thinking we, like, spam all the Mahjong instructors that, you know, we know.

We're in tons of Mahjong groups on Facebook. Would it have, like, 20,000 people in them? Mm-hmm. I truly, I don't think that's a far off number.

mean. Within six months? Is that what we're saying? six months?

[@36:44](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2204.15) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, I just put a random number out there. It's up for you guys to make a goal.

[@36:49](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2209.01) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I there is not, what we're creating, there isn't one out there right now. Yeah, that Mahj with Friends is the one I see talked about the most.

Yes, but it's not simple and easy and usual. Friendly for a beginner. I think it, I think this would turn into a resource for instructors too, to like be able to have their students down for it.

I I feel like instructors, at least for us, we're so overwhelmed with people wanting to take the class that I don't think instructors, like other instructors, are look at this as like a, We're taken away from Right.

Like, I think they're going to be like, please take some of these people, you know, so they're not, they don't keep coming to mind.

resource for their students. practice, you know.

[@37:28](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2248.26) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And if that is actually your growth channel, which is like a very like normal growth channels through referral partners, you could set up some affiliate programs where if people sign up with, you know, their link, they get a little commission on top of the monthly subscription or whatever.

So that might encourage it, might help you get to your, I mean, let's just say it's a thousand, right?

Let's say your goal is, I don't know, let's put three, six months, hit a thousand users, thousand paying customers.

How much are they paying? Like, let's do some numbers here. If they're If paying like $4 to download the app, a one-time fee, well, that's only $4,000.

And if we just gave away some commission there, then that's even less, right?

[@38:11](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2291.68) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So we definitely haven't paid mortgage. Yeah.

[@38:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2296.46) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So either we need to increase the quantity considerably, right? Which totally can happen. Figure out a different pricing model.

Maybe it's $4 to download and you still have ads, right? And they click on ads and that's, you you just get paid through DoubleClick.

That pays itself over time, but, you know, whatever. A monthly subscription will be the best revenue source, right? Because now we have recurring revenue and let's pretend that we have a lifetime value of a customer that they go, you know, maybe six months before, or maybe a year.

Maybe we get them all into annual subscriptions and they have to pay up front, right? So let's say that that's $100.

So we had $1,100, I think we made our money back there. $100. type so. So $15." We see Um, so different ways to think about it, but these are the types of decisions that we need to start going, okay, like we're, we're going to make this monetary decision because we have to work backward to at least get our investment back.

Right. I need to research that.

[@39:18](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2358.73) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I will rewrite that down on the notes because I want to research some of these other ones. Like for example, I love Maj, I think is $6 a month for that's the website.

And the way they do the affiliate stuff is that, or we'll, we don't get anything. We don't get anything.

Yeah. We have a, we have a code to give our students and they just get a three week free trial.

Right. We don't know. see. Okay. I've heard this off the top of my head. I think a monthly subscription, um, with an option for like, if you paid upfront for the year, I think that would do well because people, these ladies do not care.

Like I said, we have a mother daughter duo. They come to last six lessons and paying $50. And they're playing with beginners.

I'm like, y know how to play. Anyways, it's weird. So if these ladies, I don't think, I don't think.

But I do feel like for me personally, like if I look at something and it's like forcing me to do an annual, I'm like, right.

But I will do like, I will do monthly and then I forget about it, which is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Not smart, but.

[@40:22](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2422.72) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I mean, I think I might have told you this on my first call, but there's another mobile app that I support that it's kind of a prosumer product.

So a little similar to you guys and not purely consumer, but they're just closer down the funnel. They have an app that when you sign up, you through the iOS opt-in to the free trial, you get seven-day free trial.

If you don't cancel the free trial, they immediately charge you for it's like $71 for the year. And their conversion rate's about 50% because people forget.

And 50% conversion rate is incredible because like a normal conversion rate would be, especially in a consumer app. Somewhere below 10%.

Yeah.

[@41:03](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2463.85) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I know with some of my son's apps that he downloads, I have to look at that because I'm like, I've just had a reminder in my phone, like, cancel this before this date because, well, it's like $69.99.

If you do affiliate codes, how does that work? Like, how do you keep track of that? There's software out there for it.

[@41:19](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2479.35) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

are programs like Tapfiliate that basically it's a whole interface. It gives your referral partners their own interface where they can see how much money they're making, what referrals or whatever.

And then you're just plugging that into your software. whenever someone charges, sorry, whenever a charge is made and someone actually transacts, it automatically says, this guy's owed this amount of money.

And then at some point at the end of the month, you go, okay, I've reviewed this guy and here's, send him his PayPal, you know, whatever that is.

[@41:48](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2508.91) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

[@41:49](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2509.97) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah. Pretty easy solutions out there for it.

[@41:53](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2513.19) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

It's pretty minimal, actually. Okay.

[@41:56](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2516.59) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay. have plans here, our business goals. That might be that we have X amount of affiliates lined up, referral partners.

Our goal might be 1,000 customers within X amount of months. We can always change these things. We're just trying to get a first draft on paper.

X affiliates, we'll say just 1,000 subscribers within six months. We can always change it. And maybe we're looking at a monthly subscription somewhere around, I don't know, maybe we do an annual subscription somewhere around 60 bucks a year, maybe more.

[@42:46](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2566.02) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, because I'll research that and see kind of what these other apps, what they're going for.

[@42:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2571.8) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, but just as a starting point, that's just some way to start framing how we're thinking about the problem and the solution.

We can always change it. Okay. Thank Okay. Let's talk about the competition for just a moment. You guys have always downloaded the mobile apps that are out there, and your biggest complaint of them is that they're just not user-friendly.

Is that true?

[@43:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2595.68) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yes. Very confusing.

[@43:18](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2598.16) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And when you say they're not user-friendly, what specifically do you mean? Is the UI, is the interface bad, or is it just that they don't teach the user how to play?

[@43:26](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2606.96) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I would say all the above. A lot going on in one screen, you know, because with Mahjong, you're playing with 13 tiles.

There's already a lot going on. Just the game itself is a lot going on. So I'd say, yeah, so the initial interface, getting into the app, a lot of them are very confusing, or you have to pay before you even can see what the app looks like.

One of them, it was like automatically popped up, you know, you had to pay for your subscription before you even can see what the app looks like.

Okay. Yeah.

[@44:02](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2642.03) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So complicated screens, they don't teach you how to play. And you have to pay sometimes before you can even see the app and see if you even want to pay for it.

[@44:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2655.17) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yes. And then the help. feel like when you go to like, because like I said, I downloaded a couple apps just to see what they're like.

And I ended up deleting them because it was like I went to help, like how to even pay the app.

it was a YouTube video of how to play or how to use the app. Yeah. Got it. Let's see.

Can remind me some of the competitors you had looked at?

[@44:34](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2674.01) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I know they're in your deck.

[@44:35](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2675.85) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yes. Mahjong for friends. So it's Mahjong, M-A-H-J-O-N-G, and then the number four, friends. And then real Mahjong. So it's real.

And then they spell it M-A-H space J-O-N-G-G.

[@44:55](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2695.99) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Is that normal for them to spell like that?

[@44:58](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2698.27) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So the National Mahjong League actually. What did they say? Copyrighted? The way that's spelled. So it has something to do, I can get you the legitimate reason, but it has something to do whenever the Jewish ladies created the National Mahjong League, the American version, they had changed the spelling of the...

That is so funny.

[@45:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2724.82) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, with the two Gs.

[@45:27](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2727.08) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

And then Mahjongo is another one, which is M-A-H-J-O-N-G-O.

[@45:36](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2736.04) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And which of those is the best, from your opinion? It's Mahjongo, right?

[@45:40](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2740.58) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Mahjongo has the best graphics, I feel like. It's easier, it looks more like a traditional game table. And I feel like not as cluttered.

So they have... Go ahead.

[@45:58](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2758.16) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

If we had to pick one of these from like a design reference... standpoint. Would we pick that one?

[@46:03](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2763.45) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, I mean, different colors. It looks like a poker table, but well, so they have, so this, this app, this picture we have on here is actually, so they have automatic mahjong tables.

This resembles. That's not real life. They're like 4,000 to 10,000. Well, and I mean, they're huge. And like, unless you have like a true game room that you could store it in, nobody has that.

Right.

[@46:31](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2791.47) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay.

[@46:32](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2792.65) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Not that it makes like that big of a difference. It's still set up essentially the same. It would just be, it doesn't, it's ugly.

It looks like a poker table or like a casino table. But I would say that, that particular image on our, you know, PowerPoint or whatever kind of has a clear picture of, you know, where the tiles are, where the walls are of the game.

And you'll understand this more as when we do a lesson with you, but I like the layout better of that one, I guess, out of those.

And the other two just have bad UI?

[@47:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2826.12) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

[@47:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2826.52) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yes. Confusing. A lot of words. I feel like a lot of these apps, if there is stuff that comes up on the screen, it's a lot of text going on.

[@47:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2836.2) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Do you think they're made by American companies?

[@47:19](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2839.42) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Don't know. I do feel like Mahjong for Friends is. Isn't that guy, doesn't he advertise himself? He does. I don't know if he is.

He might be. Do want me to research that further?

[@47:33](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2853.56) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I mean, it's just, it's interesting, right? Because sometimes you do have games like this.

[@47:38](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2858.64) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, Mahjong is very Asian.

[@47:41](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2861.8) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

[@47:44](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2864.58) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That maybe an Asian company might have made it.

[@47:46](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2866.58) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And now there's like a lot of text on screen and, you know, not kind of the standards that maybe American UX has, you know?

Well, and I did find out, so American Mahjong is actually the most complicated.

[@47:55](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2875.96) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

has the most rules. Is that because of the Jewish ladies? Is that what you're saying? Yes, because of National Mahjong League card, the rules, the flow of the game.

Yes. Yeah, because we do have a, we had a lady who came to our class who only plays Chinese Mahjong and then she just learned Taiwanese Mahjong and she was like, what is this?

Wow. So.

[@48:18](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2898.66) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So she knew how to play, but she didn't know how to play by the National League rules. No, she doesn't know how to play.

[@48:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2904.04) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

American Mahjong is just totally different. Wow. They don't use, they don't use cards. Yeah. So National Mahjong League is the only one that uses the card.

Yeah. To play. Otherwise, you're basically creating, there's different versions, but for Chinese, for example, it's like you're creating like four, you have have like four of a kind, three of a kind, and then a chow, which is like one, two, three, the same suit.

So I was actually researching it to understand the different versions. I don't know what you're talking about, but.

[@48:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2931.2) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Does it, does a future world for us, mean, in a, in a perfect future world where we can have everything we want, do we include those other ways to play Chinese, Taiwanese?

[@49:00](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2940.72) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what the, that's not like the trendy popular one, you know, so I don't know what the demographic.

Yeah, I mean, I would say, mean, I don't know what the amount of people, you know, like of all the lessons we've done, there's only been two.

There was one at that private party who played Chinese. She said she grew up playing it. But this lady that she's referencing came to one of our lessons because the American Mahjong is getting so popular and kind of turned into the next Funko.

So she wanted to learn this version so then she could have the social aspect of being with other ladies.

But she didn't, she hated it. She said she wasn't going to play. So I made her think too hard.

Wow.

[@49:43](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=2983.99) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

If we had to just imagine the most perfect future version of this where you guys are wildly successful and you saw the wave coming and you rode the wave and you picked up a million users, what else are you putting into the app?

Um.

[@50:01](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3001.6) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Well, like, I mean, play with the bots, play with friends, you know, because, um, you know how, like, even words with friends and Candy Crush keeps your score, right?

I love Maj. So I feel like I love Maj.com is the most user friendly Majong website there is out there.

That's I love Maj. I love Maj.com, but they do tournaments. And so they'll do tournaments, and then you get on the leaderboard.

And so I feel like eventually this app could do that. I could also, my creative brain, Jenny has to tell me to stop sometimes because I'll bunny trail, but I could see this app.

This is, this is free reign, everything we want. What does the future look like? I could see this app eventually, like you said, featuring, oh, my Maj.com, some of these different Maj.com brands.

Okay. Also though, before we even start, yes, I agree. But before we even started with this app, Rebecca came up with an idea for another app, which I don't know if you would be able to just add this in.

To this app, but it's like, find your Mahjong players. Yeah, be able to. know, like a lot of people don't.

So we have a TeamReach channel where people, that's how people, if they don't know anybody to play Mahjong, like we encourage people to join our Facebook group and our TeamReach to find people to play with.

Just like if have a pickleball game or something, you know, you need to find somebody. Yeah, yeah. But you could find local ladies to play with.

Okay. That sounds really exciting.

[@51:37](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3097.51) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And the thing that scares me about it is like, okay, so there's a social privacy component to consider in that world where we have those kind of features as well.

Okay, cool. I'm just sorry. No, no, no, no.

[@51:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3111.89) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That's very, I don't really know how you would get around that, but I mean, I don't know. Dating apps do it, so.

Yeah, it'd be basically like a Tinder. A dating app. What was I going to say? Oh, and then so the ilovemaj.com, you can actually, you can turn on your screen and actually like play live, you know?

God. Like laying in bed? Well, I was playing one day and decided to play live and this little old lady sitting there.

Oh, actually cute. I bet she didn't have a bra on or anything. At least she didn't realize her camera was on.

Oh, that's so great. I know, but I feel like eventually this could turn into, like I said, like featuring, okay, this month we're featuring, oh, my mahjong just came out with new mahjong mats.

Those are going to be, you know, basically, oh, my mahjong will be paying us to advertise for them, you know, their newest mats that are coming out.

I never, I do not feel like it would probably be, my mahjong. I feel like it would be a lot of these other like smaller ones who are wanting to get their name out to become, my mahjong.

But I could see it also being like eventually, oh, can purchase, you know, through our app, can take you to, oh, my mahjong.

And you could purchase at a discount. But, you know, like all the tiles are so cute. Like it would be cool.

I mean, that would be so hard for like y'all, but like that would be your problem. Yeah. All 152 tiles or whatever, however many tiles, you know, they all have the cute little design on them or whatever.

But I know that that's.

[@53:20](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3200.4) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

There is a world where you could be getting affiliate sales just by pushing people to other apps. And that might make some of the subscription, like depending on how much you do a subscription, if you even do a subscription, it might add some additional revenue that kind of makes it all worth it for you in the end.

[@53:37](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3217.48) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That's true. I mean, I feel like there's a lot of, there's a lot of opportunity. Yeah. Sometimes I'm where we want to take it.

I mean, because these, go ahead.

[@53:47](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3227.4) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

What I see happening right now is like you, you guys are wanting to create kind of like, we're the experts in Mahjong.

You're going to come to us to learn how to play. And then if I tell you a product is good, then you'll trust me because you learned how to play this through me.

Right. Right. So. So. You're establishing a lot of brand authority. And so if you then say, here's like a little e-commerce flow and you're not purchasing through us, we're going to send you to a third-party site, but then we're tracking the affiliate link there.

Amazon does this really easily, for example. And you purchase, like, that's just little commission fees, you know.

[@54:20](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3260.13) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, yeah, we sort of started thinking about doing our own, you know, tiles or mats or racks or whatever, but that was too hard, that felt too risky.

Yeah, too much out there. Yeah, there's too many people trying to do that right now.

[@54:39](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3279.63) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah, yeah. And you don't need to, right? Like, you can let someone else do it and affiliate link it out, you know.

Okay, so let me just repeat back what I've heard from, like, the beautiful, perfect future state right now. We can play against robots, we can play against friends, there are tournaments, like I love Maj.

There are leaderboards, there's brand partnerships, there's potentially even, like, little communities. These are where we can join and find players near us and crazy, beautiful future state.

We can we can turn on our audio or camera when we're playing live against another player and play against grandma.

[@55:14](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3314.0) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

[@55:26](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3326.68) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I will say so, like I said, on the chess dot com, I hope you look at that later. I would have a what do you call it?

I guess it would be the tutorial, but a button that could have like definitions of different terms in the Mahjong, you know, in the Mahjong rule.

I mean, I put on my list tutorials tutorials and we could break that down further. But I feel like, yeah, we want this app to have everything you need.

It'd be like the resource. Somebody need to look up a rule or they needed to look. Oh, so like like a whole like drop like a whole.

I don't know what this is called, but like a lot like a button that you press. It has like Mahjong terms or.

Like Mahjong definitions? Because there's like a word called Pung, which is P-U-N-G, which is three like tiles. And then there's Kong, K-O-N-G, which is four like tiles.

And I would like it to have those terms in there that people could read more about it to understand, like the rules associated with that.

Because like I said, there's so many national modules, there's so many rules that as a beginner, you really have to understand all those rules to be able to.

Yeah, yeah, have a game flow.

Do you just spitballing here, allow me to be wrong. Do you see a world where, you know, there's a little custom GPT that I could chat with and ask it questions about how to play?

And it's just kind of trained on everything that you guys have given it a little extra context. Great.

[@56:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3410.95) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

You could call it your like Mahjong mentor or something. Yeah. That's not hard to build. It's really easy to build, actually.

Well, and then also in this. Chess app, they have a, and one of their dropdowns is videos, and they have videos that are rules and basics, strategy, tactics, learn to play.

They have different videos that have, you know, eventually I feel like we could have that in the tutorial aspect.

Yeah, I do like on this chess app how you can change the background, though I do feel like they're very like clip art type backgrounds, but.

[@57:31](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3451.82) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay, so some customization around like the board that we're playing with, maybe not an MVP feature, because it depends on the complexity, but like just the ability to swap out boards or even micro transactions within the app to purchase new mats, new tiles, new boards.

[@57:48](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3468.16) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That would be cute. Yeah, in this app, it's like, you know, like on an iPhone when you can like change it dark mode or change the backgrounds or change.

It's like that, where you can just, it just changes like. The background of everything, which is like so pointless, like, but it does make it more enjoyable, I guess.

Like you're looking at this pink background, it's cute.

[@58:13](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3493.94) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I mean, I don't know if you know what Fortnite is, but Fortnite as a video game is free to play and they make all of their money from these little microtransactions of people who like purchase different outfits or whatever.

And just like you're saying, it makes zero sense and they've made billions of dollars from it. Perfect.

[@58:31](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3511.56) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I would really love to make billions of dollars.

[@58:36](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3516.0) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah. Okay. So that might even be something we decide we want to include in the MVP where, you we do create some different skins on things and we just support microtransactions and helps us get to our target goal of whatever that looks like for us.

I think some ladies would like it.

[@58:53](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3533.48) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Like I said, you have the traditional tiles. They would still have our kind of cutesy spin on it. But then you have the option to have fancier or...

Or a prettier interface. I mean, it truly does make the game more enjoyable. I'm not just saying that. If we play with our white tiles on cheat mat, it's not the same as if you play with the full setup.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Cody tutorial outlines (Charleston 1–2, walls, card) \+ glossary \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3553.9999)**

There's like a little lamp that goes in. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely not the same. Okay, cool.

[@59:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3564.61) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

As far as the tutorials that you guys want to teach in the MVP, where would I be getting that content from?

Obviously from you guys, but how do you plan on going about to create that content?

[@59:36](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3576.89) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, we have like a template. mean, it's not, I guess it's verbal. Like I have an exact template that I go off of to teach a class.

And it would be not easy. mean, it would be easy for us to like say what to do. And it would be easy-ish for us to, it would be time-consuming and tedious to come up with like a template.

On On On my... Like, you know, like a deck basically to give you, but like it would, we could break it down pretty easily, I think.

Yeah, I think we could just give you that. Like we could break it down and like give you like, yeah, the verbiage of what to say easily.

[@1:00:19](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3619.82) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

About how many lessons would it be in total?

[@1:00:23](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3623.18) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Um, would say like the, the Charleston, the dealing that could really, I would say that would be two lessons, the dealing, the Charleston.

Um, I mean, we could do a very small one in terms of like, uh, walls, you know, like how to build your wall walls.

We go to the left, we go away from, you know, like that kind of thing. I feel like people get a little bit, we'll get that to you.

I would say it'd be less than five, less than five, less than five is less than five lessons, like enough to pay for.

See, these are things that we all go, so like these are in our two and half hour beginner lesson, we go over it all.

So basically, you're asking like if they were to pay like individually for these lessons on the app? Is that what you're asking?

No, no.

[@1:01:17](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3677.89) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, that's actually an interesting idea. Maybe we do give away the first lesson for free and then they have to pay to get the rest of the lessons.

Like that's definitely a gamification, like, you know, if the first lesson is really, really good and they want to learn the rest of the, you know, three lessons, maybe they have to subscribe.

Yeah.

[@1:01:36](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3696.55) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, it could also be like understanding the card could be a lesson, like understanding the, and then that one could be like every year when a new card comes out, well, it could be another lesson that we, that's like, what if people are like looking forward to it?

Like, oh, they're going to give us a breakdown of the best way to. And, you know, to understand the new card or, and that could be like a, something that they paid for every year, you know, whatever, $9.99, you get a breakdown of the 2026 card.

Yeah, because some instructors do that now. It's like when the new card comes out every April, they'll host a big, you know, I truly don't know what they say, but.

But they'll go over the new card, the section by section. I'm it could come up with something.

[@1:02:28](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3748.5) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I'm not sure I'm totally following. What, what is the card?

[@1:02:31](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3751.24) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Like the 2026 card? I don't even know if I have a card. So in our net file we had sent you, I have a picture of it in there.

I don't, I have all the cards in my house because they're all packed over and I'll go get the old one.

Okay. Okay. But it's the National Mahjong League card. So on our presentation we had sent, there was that long, let me see if we pull it up.

So it's basically all the hands that you can Mahjong on. Let me find it. So I don't know. You can't see it.

So it's this one here. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

[@1:03:09](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3789.64) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. I remember seeing that now.

[@1:03:11](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3791.6) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So they make a new one every year? This is the 2024 one. Okay. every year. And then this is all the hands you have to play.

[@1:03:22](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3802.76) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Oh.

[@1:03:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3804.32) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Or like, you know, you pick a hand to play. Yeah. so there's different, it's obviously backwards, but it's, there's different sequences.

Mm-hmm. Even though it says one, two, three, four, some of them don't have to be one, three, four. could be any four consecutive numbers and so on and so forth.

Okay. But this is what I think we had told you in our first call that we have emailed the National Mahjong League to find out.

Because it's copyrighted. So we need to find out.

[@1:03:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3831.76) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay.

[@1:03:52](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3832.66) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

How can we integrate this into our app to where, because a lot of these apps, you have to have the physical card in front of you to be able to play.

I see. Wow. And we're going to this into our app. Somehow, and some of the other apps just use like made up, right?

Like made up lines or made up sequences. Okay, okay. If we have to do that, we have to do that.

Kind of have to. Yeah, interesting.

[@1:04:14](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3854.93) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

But why do they charge or why do they make a new card every year? Do they change the rules that often?

They change the hands.

[@1:04:22](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3862.05) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So you'll still have your same sections. Like you'll still have your consecutive run section. You'll still have your quints.

Okay. They change up the different, I guess to make it more challenging. This is like, yeah, it's to make it more challenging.

So this is the 2024 card this weekend. My sister was in town and Rebecca has all of our 2025 cards.

And I have not played on the 2024 card in like a year. And so I opened up this card.

It was so much more difficult. So like, I'm just so used to playing in 2025\. So it's like, I think it's just to keep it interesting.

I mean, it was so fun because I had it. Yeah. Wow.

[@1:05:04](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3904.76) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So I wonder, even if it were a problem for us to use, you know, their rules or whatever, if we just use like a couple years old, would it make so much of a difference?

Would they, would they sue for that? think?

[@1:05:16](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3916.6) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, we could just mix up a whole bunch of years. Well, and so in some ways have created their own, like they play with the National Modular League rules, but they create their own cards.

You know, as long as every, all four players are playing on the same card, it doesn't matter. So we could technically create our own sequences.

Yeah.

[@1:05:35](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3935.16) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, something to consider for your app is if you intend to do it based on whatever the current rules are, that like obviously means you have to update it every year, which could or could not be a lot of development.

You know, we just have to make sure it's like a scalable thing. But if we instead created our own rules, that's one less thing we have to maintain over time.

Mm-hmm.

[@1:05:57](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3957.04) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That's true. On the back of the Mahjong card, it has... So one, two, three, four, five. I think there's like six.

It could be like six different tutorials. And then if you added like strategy for how to read the card, you know, what to discard, you know, that kind of thing.

I think we could probably get up to like maybe 10 or what, like 10, 8 to 10 emails. Okay.

[@1:06:32](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=3992.79) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

For the tutorials themselves, do you see this in like a form? Like here's a couple of ways you could go about it.

One is purely app and it's just like, here's a little intro with some text on what you're about to do.

And then you start the lesson and then you just play like a fake game and it kind of just forces you to do the moves.

It's just UX pattern for teaching people how to play games. Another move you could make is, so a different option here.

There's like an intro screen, but maybe there's a video. With you guys, like explaining, here's what you're about to do.

Here's why it matters. You know, you can watch a video and also play, right? What kind of formats would you be open to entertaining for actually doing the lessons in the app?

Okay.

[@1:07:17](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4037.34) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I don't know if you think this is a good idea or not, but I'll say it anyways. So what about, have you seen, I mean, I know you've seen it.

What if there's like, okay, the Charleston, I think is going to be like the main one. What if we create some sort of like, it's just a 30 second video of like, like a cartoon, basically, like just doing the Charleston and like speaking, you know, like in a traditional Charleston, and the first move, you know, is the tiles get passed to the right, you know, and then we have it as soon as you're ready for the next pass, all time, all players have to have three tiles in front of the racks face down.

You know, mean, it's just like a little 30-second video basically just showing the Charleston. So I think it has to be short and it has to be like succinct, like very few words.

Yeah. You know? So this chess.com app has kind of that built into it. Let me show you. It's like, for example, so here on the app, it says playing the game.

And then it has seven lessons underneath that. Okay. And then it has. That's exactly what I mean. Yes. Oh, hold on.

So then once you get into the playing the game, then you have down here the goal of chess. Mm-hmm.

Yeah. I like that a lot. then it goes into like. And the goal of Mahjong, it could be very simple.

Like I could do one that's like so simple that would just like. Yeah. So and then it gives you, then you actually can actually move around the.

Right.

[@1:09:00](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4140.8) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Right. Right. And then it's telling. Hey, didn't do the thing I wanted you to do. You have to do this instead.

[@1:09:05](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4145.69) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Totally.

[@1:09:06](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4146.03) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

That's a great, great UX, UI pattern, the way they're doing it. So I think I'll play around with this more.

[@1:09:11](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4151.35) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

And like I said, screen is not the same. I was even thinking like for the tutorials, like I think that could be like practice.

Yes. But like tutorial, like I feel like it could be just like a very short little like video. Video, cartoon, cartoon is probably not the right word.

But just like a little tiny video that just shows like what the Charleston looks like.

[@1:09:39](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4179.95) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

And like, but you're saying doing that as kind of an intro to actually playing it out. Or are you saying that alone?

[@1:09:45](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4185.75) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

That's the lesson. Well, that could be like the tutorial. And then they could like practice like, you know, like where they just have to watch it.

And it's like, you know, I would say less than a minute long. You know, they're not going to watch a 14 minute video on, but like less than a minute long.

And then now. Let's practice the Charleston, and then they can, like, actually do it.

[@1:10:07](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4207.96) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Yeah. For each of the lessons, would there only be one practice if you took on that model?

[@1:10:13](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4213.84) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I mean, they could practice as many times as they want, I would think. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just don't want it to be, like, where there's, like, where it gets too much, like, too busy, like, it's too many steps, you know, like, I just want it to be, like, so...

User-friendly, easy, simple, like, not, like, click here and 20 things come down. Click, and then you can click into each one of those 20 things, and then you can, you know, see if that's when people get, like, ugh.

Yeah, I agree, because I did what I was doing with these.

[@1:10:47](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4247.64) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

When you're doing these lessons, do you, should you do them, like, in the way that you present it, should you do them in chronological or linear order?

Like, I can't, I can't do, you know, building walls before I do the Charleston. So I have to, like, kind of unlock.

Each one.

[@1:11:04](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4264.07) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, guess technically, yeah, for a beginner. I feel like there should be, well, I think like you were saying, like an intro of basically like an intro about like how to mod or the goal of the game, the Charles, like you want an overview, right?

You want one video that's like an overview. Yeah. And then you could do individual like lessons, right? That would break down each step further.

Hmm. I don't really care if there's an overview or not. Like, I think that we could have them in order, but I don't necessarily like, what if somebody goes, what if somebody's gone to three lessons and they don't really need, they don't want like the chronological order, but they just can't remember exactly how to do the Charleston.

Yeah.

[@1:11:45](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4305.83) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, if they've already done it, like certainly they should be able to go back and do previous ones. Right.

[@1:11:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4311.79) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

But I mean, like, what if they, yeah. Yeah. I don't really know if I want it to be like locked to where like they have to do all of them.

Yeah. think people like find. Things that they struggle with, and then sometimes they just get stuff real quick. Which, mean, I guess if we make all the videos very short, but...

Yeah.

[@1:12:12](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4332.28) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Well, here's something to consider, and this ties in nicely to one of the last questions I have for you today, and that's gamification, right?

As an app, and this is what every app that is a game does, it is like constantly vying for your attention, right?

It wants you to be engaged with it as long as possible, because every app knows that the longer you're engaged with it, the higher retention rate they're going to have as a company, right?

So they want you always coming back into the game. If we took this approach of you unlock lessons one by one, we inherently have captured more attention as long as the user actually does everything, right?

Instead of just giving them full access to everything, pick and choose your adventure, if you want to see lesson four, but, you know, you've just started, I have you...

have to go through lessons one, two, and three before you get there. I know you're going to stay in the app longer.

You're going to get more value out of the app. That's generally the approach, right? What other ways can we introduce gamification into this application in order to capture more attention?

[@1:13:21](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4401.46) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

The first thing that comes to my mind, so on the card, this is a creative brain here. On the card, you have different sections, right?

If somebody already knows how to play, for example, I have my sections that are my go-to sections, right? What if we had challenges or something, or they could pick, okay, this is going be a consecutive run challenge or something.

You're dealt specific tiles, and you have to figure out which line you're building. I feel like you could have different challenges.

That's a good idea. That would help improve where you're not necessarily playing a game, but you're strengthening your mahjong brain.

Like, you're, like, becoming more familiar with more of the card and, you know. Yeah, and then so on the card.

And that would be good because the card changes. And so you would be able to, like, well, but our app might not change.

We might have something different. But I guess just challenges for people that do play on a regular basis. It would help strengthen their game and be able to visualize.

[@1:14:24](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4464.59) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So assuming we did actually have, like, the 2026 card or 2025 card in the app, we would show them, what is it called when it's just a section like that?

[@1:14:33](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4473.19) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Just a section. So you've got your, like, consecutive run. Okay.

[@1:14:37](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4477.21) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

So we would show them, like, a hand or I'm still learning the language here. Show them the tiles and you'd be like, what section of the card is this?

[@1:14:49](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4489.07) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

And kind of, like, train them.

[@1:14:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4490.69) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay. I guess it'd be, so I Love Maj has one that's called Heavenly Hands.

[@1:14:55](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4495.53) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

And it's a, basically, it's in their exercise section. And it's Heavenly Hands, you're dealt tiles, and you have to rearrange them to figure out.

But what line, you know, what line it is. So basically our own version of just strengthening your mahjong eye, I guess you would call it, to get quicker at, you know, identifying your tiles to mahjong quicker.

I guess it'd be more like strategy. I guess it'd be like strategy. Yeah, cool.

I love the challenges there. And adding that as an addition to just like here are lessons and practices, but like here's actually like some like essentially strength training for your brain on how to play this.

Like totally makes sense.

[@1:15:37](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4537.88) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I want say one other thing, too, is so on the card, there's points. And so when we beginners don't usually use the points.

Right. So you have your points on the side and then you've got these X's and you've got concealed. A lot of ladies will end up joining leagues and play, you know, they'll basically play in a league for six weeks.

And at the end of the six weeks, whoever has the highest points, you know, wins the league and wins prizes.

Stuff that I feel like we could incorporate, you know, like tournament training or league training eventually that would get these ladies ready for tournament play or, you know, to be able to, you know, join a league eventually.

Because I feel like a lot of these ladies are learning Mahjong and they want to get better. there could be timed exercises.

Yeah. Because these people, so when we teach beginners, I would say like the very first game they play could take like 45 minutes to an hour.

Or when you're playing in a league or in a tournament or something like that, a game is going to take like 15 minutes.

And so it's like, if we could do, if it could be like kind of like where they're on a timer to pick, you know, for the Charleston, for the, you know, just for a game or whatever to like make them think faster or whatever.

I think some sort of timed challenge would be helpful because when you're a beginner, you go so slow. And then if you're wanting to play, you know, build their confidence.

Yeah. Yeah.

[@1:17:09](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4629.64) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Okay. Very interesting. So in other words, like, it's kind of like doing a practice, but it's timed and, you know, it's kind of a pass or fail thing.

Is that what you're saying?

[@1:17:17](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4637.46) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Or just like you say, like, I would have to think about it a little bit, but I think there's something we could do with it being timed that would strengthen, like, their playing skills.

It'll basically make them decide quicker. Because, like, for example, when you're a beginner, you're second guessing yourself, like, oh, I don't know which tiles to get rid of.

And I feel like you'll understand some of this stuff more once we teach you. Yeah. Sure. Next week would be a good week if you.

Oh, he's out of town. Oh, is it? I thought it was this week. I'm out of town this week.

[@1:17:51](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4671.34) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I am also out of town next week on Monday and Tuesday. I'm in Orlando this week, Chicago next week, but I'll be back on Wednesday, the 29th.

Okay.

[@1:18:02](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4682.5) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

I have no idea. Yeah, we'll find a time. We'll find a time. Yeah, cool. Yeah.

[@1:18:07](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4687.82) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I'm in like my busy season of travel. It's not usual for me to be in it because I'll be in it of everything.

Yeah. Because then after next week, I'll be in San Diego the week after. It's fun. The other way to think about gamification is just like sometimes you do this in other applications as well, where it's like, I just want you to do certain things.

And they might be things that don't serve you actually, but they serve me as the company. Think of like if you were signed up for an app before and they were like, complete your profile.

And you got like five points and like confetti on the screen. You're like, well, that was kind of dumb, but I completed it.

And now it tells me the three other things it wants me to do. And that's gamification, right? It's like, it's literally serving as someone who is otherwise training you on how to use the app.

So we should consider even within our MVP, some sort of like scoring or levels in order for the user, like when they do certain things.

We reward them with certain trophies and their score increases and they get certain achievements. An example of this might be you've logged in like three days in a row.

That's a vanity thing, right? And the user doesn't even know that they're going toward that achievement. But when it happens, we reward them.

We throw confetti at them. We tell them they just got an achievement. Their score goes up a little bit.

Anything that we can do to get people back into the application and more engaged with it. And those little dopamine hits go a long way.

[@1:19:30](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4770.89) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

So, you know, like on Snapchat when people used to be like, how many times, you know. Like a streak, right?

Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I just never really on No, let me think about that. I like that though. Yeah.

I feel like just thinking of like these Mahjong women, they'd be like, oh, I get to choose from a different, I get pink racks this time instead of clear, you know, like little things like that.

Like, oh, that's like exciting. Right.

[@1:19:57](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4797.57) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

I've even seen some apps, like game apps like that, where it's like, you have to unlock a Like the opportunity to purchase.

And it's like so stupid.

[@1:20:08](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4808.86) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yes. Well, I feel like some of these kid apps are like that. Some games might be plays. It's like, yeah, wait, we're not there yet.

We just, or it's like, you know, you got to wait like 30 minutes before you can like spin the wheel again or something, you know?

Right. I mean, as long as it's not like when you get on like Timu or like, oh my gosh, that is miserable.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Cody gamification research (Candy Crush, streaks, timed challenges) \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4822.9999)**

Like it makes you so many pop-ups. Yeah. So many pop-ups. So many, you can knock it away from them.

Let me do some more research on some other apps and kind of see. Yeah. Okay. Can I give you guys some homework?

I have a lot of homework to do. Please. Let me give you guys some homework. I feel unprepared going into this meeting because I feel like you loves homework.

[@1:20:50](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4850.4) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

No, she's always like, what else do we do?

[@1:20:52](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4852.12) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

What else do do?

[@1:20:53](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4853.46) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

We're all coming into this with fresh brains and I'm the perfect person to be doing this app because I know nothing about Mahjong, right?

**ACTION ITEM: Email Cody problem/solution statements \+ positioning statement draft \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4856.9999)**

And if this works for me, it's going to work for everyone else, right? So here's what I would like you guys to do.

Let's very clearly define the problem in the business solution. So we already have kind of rough of that. I can send it after the call if you want.

We talked about Mahjong being a nuanced and complicated game and that this app should allow players to become more confident.

That could just be the same. Maybe you don't change that, but let's make sure we have a true problem statement written down.

**ACTION ITEM: Email Cody MVP business goals (subscribers, timeframe, affiliates) \- [WATCH](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4885.9999)**

And then your solution is Mahjong instructor in an app, just more clearly defined. This is how we solve the business problem.

We do need to make some decisions around what our goals are for the MVP. So our business goals are X affiliates, X number of subscribers.

If we're doing subscription model within X period of time, monthly subscription, annual subscription, pay once, pay per lesson, no pay ads, lots of different options there.

And I think that is everything I have for you. One other thing, if you want to go varsity, is to create a positioning statement.

You know what this is? No, explain. A positioning statement, companies often do it in their early stages, and basically it's formatted like this.

Every positioning statement is the same. It's for dot, dot, dot, candy crush moms who have extra time on their hands and are interested in learning how to play Mahjong, who dot, dot, dot, struggle with learning how to play Mahjong and can't find a mobile app that serves them.

Whatever the name of your company is going to be, Mahjong app is dot, dot, dot, a mobile app that serves blah, blah, blah.

Unlike, is the next one, dot, dot, dot, competitors who have clunky UI or no training, whatever we've discussed. And that's your positioning statement.

So if you are able to very clearly say that, that's your elevator pitch. If you were to go in for investors, it's also like the way you literally onboard anybody into understanding what your company is and who you serve.

[@1:23:15](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=4995.76) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Yeah, we'll work on that because I think that's important. I do too. And it'll help us stay on track of where we really want this thing to go.

Absolutely. Yeah.

[@1:23:26](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=5006.16) \- **Cody Miles (brandcave.co)**

Cool. Okay. Well, here's my next steps. I'm going to create some context documents, taking what I've learned from you guys, doing my own research.

And then I'm just, my goal is to present you guys with documents around like your user personas and all these other things as a first draft.

So we can argue about them because it's easier to have a conversation about something that exists than something that doesn't exist.

Right. So I'm going to make a ton of assumptions. I'm probably going to get a ton of things wrong, but I'm to come back to you guys with a bunch of documents for you to review and tell me where I got it wrong.

[@1:23:55](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD?timestamp=5035.46) \- **Genny & Rebekah**

Perfect. Perfect. So we could sit down and we can give you the lingo so you can have a better.

Yes. Yes.
