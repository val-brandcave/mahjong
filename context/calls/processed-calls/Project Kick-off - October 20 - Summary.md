## Call Metadata

**Date:** October 20, 2024
**Duration:** 86 minutes
**Recording:** [Fathom Video Link](https://fathom.video/share/oY5fzye7FjxbJRXs9KdkxkQt8oe17dqD)

**Participants:**
- **Cody Miles** - Product Designer/Developer (brandcave.co)
- **Genny & Rebekah** - Mahjong Instructors & App Founders

---

## Executive Summary

This initial discovery call established the foundation for a National Mahjong League mobile application designed to help players practice and improve their skills. The primary target audience is women aged 40-70 (dubbed the "Pickleball Mom" or "Candy Crush Mom"), who are either new to Mahjong or need additional practice beyond in-person lessons. Genny and Rebekah, who currently teach Mahjong classes in the Austin area, identified a gap in the market for a user-friendly, beginner-focused practice app that complements their instruction business.

The project will follow a phased discovery approach: creating context documents, developing an entity relationship blueprint, mapping information architecture, and potentially building an AI proof-of-concept prototype. The team discussed extensive feature possibilities for future versions while working to define a minimal viable product (MVP) focused on tutorials and practice modes. Key challenges include determining whether to include bot opponents in the MVP, addressing National Mahjong League card copyright issues, and establishing an effective monetization strategy.

The call concluded with action items for both parties to refine business goals, define problem/solution statements, research competitors, and schedule a hands-on Mahjong lesson for October 29th to give Cody practical experience with the game.

## Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Project Approach & Process

**Cody's Discovery Process:**
- Create context documents to understand the game, players, and world-building
- Develop entity relationship blueprint (high-level database model)
- Map information architecture (user flows and page sequences)
- Attempt to build an AI proof-of-concept clickable prototype (may be challenging due to game/3D elements)
- Fall back to traditional flowchart approach if AI prototype isn't feasible

**Design Philosophy:**
- Emphasize using existing design patterns rather than being overly creative
- Leverage design references from successful apps to avoid mistakes
- Focus on emulating what works in similar applications

### 2. User Personas & Target Audience

**Three Identified User Groups:**

**Persona 1: Traditional Mahjong Player**
- Age: 60+ years old
- Female demographic
- Been playing for 30+ years
- Very particular about rules, plays "by the book"
- Needs very user-friendly and simple interface
- Less tech-savvy

**Persona 2: The "Pickleball Mom" (PRIMARY TARGET)**
- Age: 40-70 years old (specifically 50s-60s sweet spot)
- Female demographic
- New to Mahjong, coming from games like Bunko
- Hopping on trends (Pickleball, now Mahjong)
- Similar to "Candy Crush Mom" - willing to spend time and money on mobile games
- Needs simple, accessible interface
- **This is the primary user persona for MVP**

**Persona 3: Trendy Young Crowd**
- Age: College to young moms (early 20s to ~35)
- Love the aesthetic/style aspect of Mahjong
- Willing to spend money on the game
- Tech-savvy
- Secondary audience

**Key Insight:** Men are NOT the target demographic - only play if forced by wives at home. The app is exclusively focused on female users.

### 3. Problem & Solution Statements

**Problem Statement (Draft):**
Mahjong is a nuanced and complicated game. Players struggle to become confident in playing between lessons, leading to repeated beginner classes and slow skill development.

**Specific Problems Identified:**
- Students pay $60 for beginner classes but can't retain information
- Not enough time to offer appropriate advanced classes due to demand for beginner sessions
- Students keep returning to beginner classes repeatedly
- No good practice options between in-person lessons
- Charleston (tile-passing process) is intimidating and confusing for beginners
- Existing apps are confusing, cluttered, and not user-friendly

**Solution Statement (Draft):**
Create a "Mahjong instructor in an app" that provides clear, step-by-step tutorials and practice opportunities, allowing players to build confidence outside of formal lessons.

**Solution Features:**
- Clear and simple step-by-step tutorials
- Practice mode with bots or against other players
- Focus on making Mahjong accessible to beginners
- Become the go-to resource that instructors recommend to students

### 4. Game Modes & Rules

**National Mahjong League (NML) Rules:**
- The app will focus exclusively on National Mahjong League rules for MVP
- American Mahjong is the most complicated version with the most rules
- Created by Jewish ladies who changed the game from traditional Asian versions
- Includes the "Charleston" - a tile-passing process before gameplay begins
- Uses a physical card that changes annually with different "hands" to play

**Other Versions (Future Consideration):**
- Chinese Mahjong
- Taiwanese Mahjong
- "Messy Mahjong" (house rules without Charleston)
- These could be added in future versions but are NOT part of MVP

**The Charleston:**
- Series of tile passes before the game begins
- Takes ~30 minutes to teach in beginner classes
- Pass right, pass across, pass left, includes "courtesy pass"
- Major pain point for beginners - intimidating and confusing
- Should have specific tutorial/practice focus in app

**National Mahjong League Card:**
- Physical card showing all valid "hands" (winning combinations)
- Released annually in April with new patterns
- Copyright concern - need permission to use or create own sequences
- All players must use same card/sequences for fair play
- Card costs apply annually
- Some apps require physical card alongside digital play

### 5. MVP Feature Scope Discussion

**Core Features Being Considered:**

**Must-Have (Strong Consensus):**
- Tutorial lessons teaching game fundamentals
- Charleston-specific tutorial/practice (high priority pain point)
- Practice modes
- Simple, user-friendly interface with oversized buttons
- Clear visual design (not cluttered)
- National Mahjong League rules only

**Under Debate for MVP:**
- **Bot opponents:** Provides essential practice but may require technical complexity
  - Benefit: Users can practice anytime without waiting for other players
  - Benefit: Essential before app has critical mass of users
  - Challenge: Technical complexity unknown - needs assessment
  - Reference: ilovemaj.com has bots with easy/intermediate/hard levels

- **Online multiplayer:** Allows playing against real people
  - May be more complex than bots (needs technical assessment)
  - Not viable alone at launch due to low user base
  - Could be post-MVP feature

**Alternate MVP Approach Discussed:**
- Start with tutorials and practice exercises ONLY (no full game against bots)
- Simpler scope, faster to market
- Question: Is this enough for users to pay for?
- Answer: Possibly for 1-2 months of use, but limited long-term retention

**Technical Assessment Needed:**
- Compare complexity: bot opponents vs. online multiplayer
- Cody to consult with video game developer in his building

## Important Quotes & Insights

**On Target Audience:**
> "There is not going to be men downloading this app... Only if their wives play and their wives force them to play at home." - Genny & Rebekah

**On MVP Philosophy:**
> "MVP is a minimal viable product. What we're looking for is the least amount of things we need to do to make money. Partnering with brands, that's a V1.5 or a V2." - Cody

**On User Persona:**
> "The Pickleball Mom... my mom will straight up ignore everything that's happening in her life to stare at Candy Crush." - Genny & Rebekah

**On Competition:**
> "There is not, what we're creating, there isn't one out there right now... [Competitors are] not simple and easy and user-friendly for a beginner." - Genny & Rebekah

**On Problem Being Solved:**
> "They pay us $60 to come to a class. They leave that class and they don't know how to play Mahjong because it's so nuanced and complicated. We don't have enough time to do the appropriate kinds of classes that people need after they've taken a beginner class." - Genny & Rebekah

**On Gamification:**
> "Every app knows that the longer you're engaged with it, the higher retention rate they're going to have as a company. Those little dopamine hits go a long way." - Cody

**On Revenue Goals:**
> "I think the main concern would be obviously getting our initial investment back... As long as we get that back, then the rest is just like that's fine. We're both stay-at-home moms. We're blessed that we don't have to financially contribute." - Genny & Rebekah
