**Recommended Strategy: Partnership**
Position as "what instructors wish their students had" and build instructor referral network. Make classes MORE successful, not compete with them.

Our founders' credibility and instructor network are the primary distribution channel. Must maintain instructor relationships above all else.

**Business Model Alignment:**
- Makes instructors more effective (more advanced classes)

- Improves student success (their reputation)

**Win-Win Scenario:**
Students learn faster → progress to advanced classes → instructors make more money → recommend our app more → more students succeed → cycle continues.
