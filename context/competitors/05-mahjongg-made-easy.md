### Competitive Messaging

**Against Them:**
"Videos teach you what to do. We let you actually do it—with instant feedback so you know you're learning correctly."

## Key Takeaways

### What We Learned
1. **Passive learning has limits:** Videos can't provide practice
2. **Established market:** People already buying learning content
3. **Different formats:** Not direct competition
4. **Complementary opportunity:** Could partner, not fight

### Strategic Imperatives
1. **Emphasize Interactivity:** Our unique value
2. **Learning Science:** Active > passive research
3. **Don't Compete:** Different solution to same problem
4. **Explore Partnership:** Could refer to each other

### Red Flags to Watch
- If they build interactive component
- If they partner with competing app
- If they offer subscription model

**Competitive Threat Level: LOW**
- Different format (passive vs. active)
- Can't offer hands-on practice
- Dated distribution model
- More complementary than competitive

**Recommended Strategy: Complementary Positioning**
Position as the practice companion to video learning. "Watched a video? Now practice here." Potential partnership opportunity rather than competitive threat.

**Key Insight:** They teach the "what," we teach the "how" through practice. Complementary, not competitive.
