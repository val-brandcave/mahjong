### Competitive Advantage

- **Solution:** "Finally, an app built for beginners"
- **Differentiation:** "Step-by-step lessons, not trial by fire"

### Channel Strategy
1. **Instructor Network:** Primary distribution advantage
2. **App Store ASO:** Target beginner keywords they miss

3. Beginners are underserved segment
4. UX is our competitive moat

### Strategic Imperatives
1. **Never Compromise UX:** Our only sustainable advantage
2. **Own "Beginner-Friendly":** Clear positioning
3. **Instructor Channel First:** Faster than competing for awareness
4. **Learning Over Playing:** Different lane = less competition

### Red Flags to Watch
- If they launch major UX overhaul

- If instructors start recommending them
- If they go freemium with better onboarding

**Competitive Threat Level: Medium**
- High awareness but poor execution
- Unlikely to pivot to learning focus

- Complementary more than competitive

**Recommended Strategy: Differentiate, Don't Fight**
Position as pre-game learning tool, not game replacement. Win the instructor channel, let them keep the player channel.
