**Category:** Completion Challenges
**Difficulty:** Easy, Medium, Hard
**Duration:** 3-4 minutes

## Description

**Objective:** Determine if you can still complete your hand based on what's been discarded.

## Mechanics

1. Show your tiles + target hand
2. Show discard pile
3. User determines: "Can you complete this hand?"
   - Yes (tiles still available)
   - Maybe (some needed tiles gone, Jokers might help)
   - No (too many dead tiles, must pivot)
4. System validates assessment
5. 8 scenarios

## Difficulty Levels

**Easy:** Obvious (all needed tiles discarded or clearly available)
**Medium:** Partial availability, need to count
**Hard:** Complex counting, multiple tile needs, strategic judgment

## Scoring

- Correct assessment: +250
- Detailed reasoning: +150
- Perfect analysis (8/8): +2,000

**Max:** 5,200 points
