# Challenge 1.2: Spot the Pattern

## Challenge Metadata

**Challenge ID:** PATTERN-002
**Category:** Pattern Recognition
**Difficulty Levels:** Easy, Medium, Hard
**Duration:** 4-6 minutes
**Unlock:** 20 stars required
**Skills:** Pattern identification, strategic thinking, card reading

---

## Description

**Objective:** Given your 13 tiles (after Charleston), identify 2-3 possible hands you could realistically pursue.

**Why:** This is exactly what you do in a real game - evaluating which hands are achievable with your current tiles.

---

## Mechanics

### Setup
- Display 13 tiles in organized rack
- NML card accessible
- 5 scenarios per session
- No time limit (strategic thinking focus)

### Gameplay
1. View your 13-tile rack
2. Browse NML card
3. Select 2-3 possible hands you could pursue
4. System evaluates selections:
   - Realistic? (tiles match pattern)
   - Optimal? (closest to completion)
   - All found? (didn't miss obvious options)
5. Feedback and scoring
6. Next scenario

---

## Difficulty Levels

**Easy:** Clear patterns, 3-4 obvious hands, tiles strongly match
**Medium:** Multiple reasonable options, need careful evaluation
**Hard:** Ambiguous tiles, many distant possibilities, strategic judgment needed

---

## Scoring

- Each valid hand found: +200 points
- Optimal hand identified: +100 bonus
- All realistic hands found: +300 bonus
- Strategic explanation bonus: +50

**Per Scenario Max:** 900 points
**Total Max:** 4,500 points (5 scenarios)

---

## 3-Star Requirements

⭐ 1 Star: Find at least 1 valid hand per scenario (5/5)
⭐⭐ 2 Stars: Find 2+ valid hands per scenario consistently
⭐⭐⭐ 3 Stars: Identify all realistic options in 4/5 scenarios

---

## Example Scenario

**Your Tiles:**
2 Bam, 2 Bam, 3 Bam, 3 Bam, 4 Bam, 5 Bam, Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Joker, Joker, 7 Dot, East Wind

**Possible Hands:**
1. ✓ Consecutive Run (using 2-3-4-5 Bam pattern)
2. ✓ Dragon pattern (have 3 Red Dragons)
3. ✗ Quints (not close to any)

**Optimal:** Consecutive Run (have pairs and sequence)
