## Competitive Response Strategy

### If Compared to Free YouTube Videos:
"YouTube is great for watching, but Mahjong requires doing. Our interactive lessons give you hands-on practice with instant feedback, so you actually retain what you learn. Plus, our structured curriculum ensures you don't miss critical concepts."

### If Compared to In-Person Classes:
"In-person classes are wonderful for social learning, but they're expensive, time-consuming, and can be intimidating. Our app lets you practice privately at your own pace, then join the game when you're confident. Many of our users combine both approaches—learn with us, then refine with a teacher."

### If Compared to Free Competitors:
"Free apps are often incomplete, ad-heavy, or abandoned by developers. We're committed to providing a premium learning experience with regular updates, expert content, and responsive support. Our freemium model means you can try risk-free, then upgrade if you want the full experience."

### If Asked "Why Not Just Use the Instruction Booklet?":
"Instruction booklets are great references, but they're static text. Most people learn best by doing. Our interactive lessons let you manipulate tiles, practice the Charleston step-by-step, and get instant feedback on your decisions. It's the difference between reading about swimming and actually getting in the pool."
