# Mahjong App - Project Overview

## Project Vision

Create a beginner-friendly National Mahjong League mobile application that helps players practice and build confidence between lessons. The app will serve as a "Mahjong instructor in your pocket," making this nuanced game accessible to newcomers through clear tutorials and practice opportunities.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary User: "The Pickleball Mom" / "Candy Crush Mom"
- **Age:** 40-70 years old (sweet spot: 50s-60s)
- **Gender:** Female (exclusive focus)
- **Characteristics:**
  - New to Mahjong, coming from games like Bunko
  - Trend-driven (Pickleball → Mahjong)
  - Willing to spend time and money on mobile games
  - Not tech-savvy - needs simple, intuitive interface
  - Has disposable income and leisure time

### Secondary Personas
- **Traditional Players:** 60+ years, playing 30+ years, very particular about rules
- **Trendy Young Crowd:** College to young moms (20s-30s), love the aesthetic

**Key Insight:** Men are NOT the target demographic - the app is exclusively focused on female users.

---

## The Problem

**Core Problem:**
Mahjong is a nuanced and complicated game. Players struggle to become confident between lessons, leading to repeated beginner classes and slow skill development.

**Specific Pain Points:**
- Students pay $60 for beginner classes but can't retain information
- Not enough advanced classes available due to overwhelming beginner demand
- No good practice options between in-person lessons
- Charleston (tile-passing process) is intimidating and confusing
- Existing apps are cluttered, confusing, and not beginner-friendly

---

## The Solution

Create an intuitive mobile app that provides:
- Clear, step-by-step interactive tutorials
- Practice modes for skill building
- Charleston-specific training (major pain point)
- Simple, uncluttered interface with oversized buttons
- Beginner-focused approach that complements in-person instruction

**Goal:** Become the go-to resource that Mahjong instructors recommend to their students.

---

## MVP Scope (In Discussion)

### Confirmed Features
- Tutorial lessons teaching game fundamentals
- Charleston-specific tutorial/practice (high priority)
- National Mahjong League rules only
- Simple, user-friendly interface
- Clear visual design (not cluttered)

### Under Debate
- **Bot opponents:** Essential for practice, complexity needs assessment
- **Online multiplayer:** May be more complex, could be post-MVP
- **Alternate approach:** Start with tutorials and practice exercises ONLY (no full game)

### Technical Assessment Needed
- Compare complexity: bot AI vs. online multiplayer
- Determine if tutorial-only MVP is viable for monetization

---

## Design Direction

### Aesthetic References
- **Oh My Mahjong:** Bright colors, pretty patterns, elevated vibe, modern aesthetic
- **Chess.com:** Simple UX/UI, clear navigation, excellent tutorial system
- **Candy Crush:** Engagement mechanics, monetization model, gamification

### Design Principles
- Bright, colorful, elevated aesthetic
- Clean, simple, uncluttered
- Big buttons for less tech-savvy users
- Traditional with modern "cutesy" spin
- Pattern-based customization options

---

## Monetization Strategy (Options)

### Top Considerations
1. **Subscription Model**
   - Monthly: $4-6/month
   - Annual: $60-100/year
   - 7-day free trial with auto-conversion

2. **Freemium**
   - First lesson free, unlock additional lessons
   - Pay-per-lesson model
   - Annual card breakdown ($9.99 when released each April)

3. **In-App Purchases**
   - Tile designs, mats, backgrounds, themes
   - Fortnite model: free to play, monetize cosmetics

4. **Affiliate Revenue**
   - Partner with Mahjong brands (Oh My Mahjong, etc.)
   - Instructor referral program (Tapfiliate)
   - Commission from product sales

5. **Advertising**
   - In-app ads (passive revenue)
   - Combine with low download fee

### Revenue Goals
- **Primary:** Recover initial investment (~$30K estimate)
- **Target:** 1,000 subscribers within 6 months
- **Example:** 1,000 users × $100 annual = $100,000

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (All Have Poor UX)
- **Mahj with Friends:** Most talked about, NOT user-friendly
- **Real Mahjong:** Bad UI
- **Mahjongo:** Best graphics among competitors, still has UI issues
- **I Love Mahj (website):** Most user-friendly ($6/month), currently recommended to students

### Common Competitor Problems
- Confusing interfaces
- Cluttered screens (too much text)
- Not beginner-friendly
- Require payment before seeing the app
- Poor help systems (link to YouTube videos)

### Opportunity
No simple, beginner-friendly app currently exists for American Mahjong. Clear market gap for instructors to recommend to students.

---

## Game Rules & Content

### National Mahjong League (NML) Focus
- American Mahjong is the most complicated version
- Includes the "Charleston" tile-passing process
- Uses annual card with valid "hands" (winning combinations)
- New card released each April

### The Charleston
- Series of tile passes before gameplay begins
- Takes ~30 minutes to teach in beginner classes
- Pass right → pass across → pass left → courtesy pass
- **Major pain point for beginners**

### Tutorial Topics (8-10 Total, <5 for MVP)
1. Charleston (could be 2 lessons)
2. Dealing process
3. Building walls
4. Understanding the card
5. Goal of Mahjong
6. Tiles overview
7. Strategy
8. Rules & special situations
9. Points system
10. Concealed vs. exposed hands

### Preferred Tutorial Format
- **Interactive practice** (like Chess.com)
- Brief text introduction
- Force user to perform actions to progress
- Can't advance until correct move is made
- Hands-on learning approach

---

## Gamification Strategy

### Core Engagement Mechanics
- **Achievements:** Trophies, badges, points
- **Streaks:** Daily login rewards (Snapchat model)
- **Unlocks:** New customization options, challenges
- **Profile Completion:** Rewards for setup
- **Timed Challenges:** Charleston speed, decision-making practice
- **Challenge Modes:** Given tiles, identify correct hand
- **Customization Rewards:** Earn new tile designs, backgrounds, racks

### Reference Models
- Candy Crush: Addictive game mechanics
- Snapchat: Streak system
- Fortnite: Cosmetic monetization

## Technical Considerations

### Platform
- Mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Touch-friendly, responsive design

### Key Challenges
- Game logic for Mahjong rules
- Bot AI development (complexity TBD)
- Online multiplayer synchronization
- Annual card updates (if using NML cards)
- Copyright/licensing with National Mahjong League

### Copyright/Legal Issues
- NML copyrighted spelling "Mahjongg" (double G)
- NML card is copyrighted intellectual property
- Need permission from NML or create custom sequences
- Alternative: Custom card = one-time development, no annual maintenance

---

## Project Team

### Founders/Instructors
- **Genny & Rebekah**
- Teach Mahjong classes in Austin, Texas
- Taught 600-700 students since February (8 months)
- Charge ~$60 per 2.5-hour beginner class

3. Map information architecture (user flows)
4. Build AI proof-of-concept prototype (or traditional flowchart)
5. Create user personas

8. Establish monetization strategy

### Design Philosophy
