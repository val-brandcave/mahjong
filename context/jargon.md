The physical card released annually by the National Mahjong League showing all valid "hands" (winning combinations) for that year. Released each April with new patterns. All players must use the same card for fair play.

### Charleston
A series of tile passes that occurs before the game begins. Includes passing tiles right, across, left, and an optional courtesy pass. Takes ~30 minutes to teach in beginner classes. **Major pain point for beginners.**

### Chinese Mahjong
A version of Mahjong played with different rules than American Mahjong. Considered for post-MVP features but not part of initial scope.

### Concealed Hand
A winning hand where tiles are not revealed/exposed to other players until winning. Typically worth more points than exposed hands.

### Courtesy Pass
The optional final pass in the Charleston sequence, allowing players to exchange tiles with the person opposite them.

### Dealing
The process of distributing tiles to players at the start of a game. One of the core tutorial topics.

### Exposed Hand
A winning hand where tiles are revealed to other players during gameplay (through Pungs, Kongs, etc.). Typically worth fewer points than concealed hands.

### Taiwanese Mahjong
Another version of Mahjong with its own rule set. Considered for post-MVP features but not part of initial scope.

### Tiles
The 152 pieces used in American Mahjong, including bamboos, characters, dots, winds, dragons, flowers, and jokers.
