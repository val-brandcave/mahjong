## Topics Covered

### 1. Turn Sequence
- **Draw** a tile from the wall
- **Discard** a tile you don't want
- Announce discard clearly
- Each turn: Draw → Discard

### 2. Starting the Game
- East goes first (has 14 tiles already)
- East discards first (no draw)
- Then South draws and discards
- Continue counter-clockwise

### 3. Calling Tiles
- When someone discards, you can "CALL" if you need it
- Calling exposes your tiles (no longer concealed)
- Cannot call for concealed hands (hands marked with C)
- First person to call gets the tile

### 4. Turn Rotation
- Counter-clockwise: East → South → West → North → East...
- When someone calls, they take their turn immediately
- Then continue from that person

### 5. Dead Hands
- Too many or too few tiles = Dead hand (you're out)
- Cannot win rest of game if dead
- Be careful counting tiles!

### 6. Drawing from the Wall

- Continue along the wall
- When wall section ends, continue to next player's wall

## Content Structure

### Screen 1: Introduction to Gameplay
**Text:**
```
Let's Play Mahjong!

You've learned setup and the Charleston. Now let's play!

The game is simple:
• Draw a tile from the wall
• Discard a tile you don't want
• Try to complete a hand from the card

First person to complete their hand wins!

Let's learn the details...
```

---

### Screen 2: East Goes First
**Text:**
```
East Starts the Game

Remember: East has 14 tiles (everyone else has 13).

East's first turn:
• Does NOT draw (already has 14)
• DISCARDS one tile
• Announces discard clearly ("Four Bam")
• Places tile face-up in center

Now South goes...
```

**Interactive:** Watch East's first turn animation

---

### Screen 3: Everyone Else's Turn
**Text:**
```
Standard Turn Sequence

South (and all other players):
1. DRAW one tile from the wall
2. Look at your hand (now you have 14)
3. DISCARD one tile you don't want (back to 13)
4. Announce discard clearly
5. Next player's turn

Every turn: Draw → Discard

Simple!
```

**Interactive:** Practice 5 turns (draw and discard)

---

### Screen 4: Calling Tiles - The Basics
**Text:**
```
Calling Tiles (Exposing)

When someone discards, you can shout "CALL!" if you need that tile.

Rules for calling:
✓ You must need that exact tile for your hand
✓ You immediately expose those tiles (place face-up on table)
✓ You discard a different tile
✓ Your turn continues from there

✗ Cannot call for CONCEALED hands (marked with C on card)
✗ Cannot call your own discard
```

**Visual:** Animation showing player calling and exposing tiles

---

### Screen 5: What Happens When You Call
**Text:**
```
Calling Sequence

1. Player A discards "5 Dot"
2. You shout "CALL!" (you need 5 Dot)
3. Take the 5 Dot tile
4. Expose the grouping on table (show everyone)
5. Discard a different tile from your rack
6. Play continues from YOU (not next player in order)

Important: Once exposed, those tiles stay face-up rest of game!
```

**Interactive:** Practice calling scenarios (when to call, when not to call)

---

### Screen 6: When You CAN'T Call
**Text:**
```
When You Cannot Call

You CANNOT call if:
❌ Your hand is marked CONCEALED (C) on the card
❌ You don't actually need that tile for your pattern
❌ It's your own discard
❌ Someone else called it first

If your hand is concealed, you must draw all tiles yourself - no calling!
```

**Quiz:** Show scenarios - can you call or not?

---

### Screen 7: Turn Rotation
**Text:**
```
Turn Order (Counter-Clockwise)

Normal play: East → South → West → North → East → South...

When someone calls:
• Play continues from that person
• Skip remaining players
• Regular rotation resumes

Example:
- East discards
- West calls (skips South)
- West discards
- North goes next
- Then East, South, West, North...
```

**Interactive:** Animation showing turn order with and without calls

---

### Screen 8: Dead Hands
**Text:**
```
Dead Hands (Mistakes That Disqualify You)

Be careful! These mistakes make you "dead" (out of the game):

❌ Too many tiles (15+ in rack)
❌ Too few tiles (12 or fewer in rack)
❌ Expose tiles when hand must be concealed
❌ Call when you can't use the tile

If you're dead, you finish the game but cannot win.

Count your tiles carefully!
```

### Screen 9: Complete Game Simulation

**Text:**
```

You'll play through several turns:
• Charleston already complete
• You have 13 tiles
