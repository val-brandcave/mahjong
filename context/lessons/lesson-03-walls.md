**Tone:** Instructional but encouraging, like teaching a physical skill
**Approach:** Visual demonstration, step-by-step guidance, interactive practice
**Key Message:** "Building walls looks complicated, but it's just stacking tiles in a pattern. You've got this!"

## Lesson Content Structure

### Screen 1: Introduction to Walls
**Visual:** Overhead view of Mahjong table showing completed four walls in square formation

**Text:**
```
Building the Walls

Before you can play Mahjong, you need to build the "walls."

These are stacks of face-down tiles that form a square in the center
of the table. Each player builds their own wall.

Let's learn how!
```

**Narration Script (20 seconds):**
```
Before playing Mahjong, all 152 tiles need to be arranged into four walls.
Each player builds one wall in front of them, then they're pushed together
to form a square.

Don't worry - it's much easier than it looks! Let's start building.
```

**Interactive Element:**
- 3D or clear 2D overhead view of table
- Rotate view to see from different angles (tap and drag)
- Zoom in on one wall to see detail
- "Show me how!" button

**Design Notes:**
- Clear overhead perspective
- Show all four walls in square formation
- Use different colors for each player's wall
- Emphasize the square shape created

---

### Screen 2: Wall Dimensions
**Visual:** Close-up of single wall with measurements clearly labeled

**Text:**
```
Wall Size

Each wall is made of:
• 19 pairs of tiles (length)
• 2 tiles high (stacked)
• Total: 38 tiles per wall

With 4 players, that's 152 tiles total!
```

**Narration Script (20 seconds):**
```
Let's look at one wall up close.

Each wall is 19 tiles long and 2 tiles high. That means you'll stack 19
pairs of tiles in a row - giving you 38 tiles per wall.

Since there are 4 players, 4 walls of 38 tiles each equals all 152 tiles!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Animated diagram showing wall dimensions
- Counter showing tiles: "38 tiles per wall"
- Tap to highlight length (19 pairs)
- Tap to highlight height (2 tiles stacked)
- Math display: "38 × 4 players = 152 tiles"

**Visual Detail:**
- Clear measurement lines showing 19 tiles length
- Visible stacking of 2 tiles high
- Numbers/labels for clarity
- Color-coded to match previous screen

**Design Notes:**
- Make dimensions very clear
- Show relationship between wall size and total tiles
- Use animation to demonstrate concept
- Simple arithmetic reinforces understanding

**Narration Script (30 seconds):**
```
Here's how to build your wall step-by-step.

First, take 38 tiles and flip them face-down. Then, stack them in pairs -
two tiles on top of each other. Make 19 of these pairs.

Finally, arrange all 19 pairs in a straight line in front of you. That's it -
you've built your wall!
```

🟡 EAST - The starting player (dealer)
🔴 SOUTH - To East's right
⚫ WEST - Across from East
🔵 NORTH - To East's left

Players rotate counter-clockwise around the table.
```

**Narration Script (25 seconds):**
```
In Mahjong, each player sits in a directional position.

East is the starting player and dealer. Moving counter-clockwise around the
table, we have South to East's right, West opposite East, and North to
East's left.

Remember: East always starts the game!
```

**Interactive Element:**

### Screen 6: Pushing Walls Together
**Visual:** Overhead view showing all four players pushing their walls toward center

**Text:**
```
Bringing It All Together

Once all four players have built their walls, everyone pushes their
wall toward the center at the same time.

The four walls form a square "cage" in the middle of the table.
```

**Narration Script (20 seconds):**
```
After everyone finishes building their wall, it's time to bring them together.

On the count of three, all players push their walls toward the center
simultaneously. The four walls meet to form a perfect square - the playing
structure for the game.

Let's see it in action!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Animation showing 4 walls sliding toward center
- User initiates by pressing "Push walls together"
- Satisfying snap/click when walls meet

### Screen 7: The Complete Setup
**Visual:** Beautiful overhead shot of completed four-wall square

**Text:**
```
The Complete Wall Setup

All 152 tiles arranged in a square!

Each wall: 19 tiles long × 2 tiles high = 38 tiles
Four walls: 38 × 4 = 152 tiles total

This setup stays in place throughout the entire game.

Next up: You'll learn how to deal tiles from these walls!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Tap each wall to see its measurements
- Rotate 3D view to see from all angles
- Highlight individual tiles

### Screen 8: Understanding "Breaking" the Wall
**Visual:** Wall with visual indicator showing where break occurs

**Text:**
```
One More Thing: Breaking the Wall

Before dealing tiles, one wall needs to be "broken" - this is where
dealing begins.

The East player rolls dice to determine which wall to break and where.

Don't worry about the details yet - we'll cover this in the next lesson!

For now, just know that "breaking" means starting the dealing process.
```

**Narration Script (20 seconds):**
```
There's one more concept to understand: breaking the wall.

After building the square, the East player rolls dice. This determines which
wall to break and where to start dealing tiles.

We'll learn the details in the next lesson. For now, just remember that
"breaking the wall" is where dealing begins.
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Animation showing dice roll
- Highlight of wall section being "broken"
- Visual gap in wall where dealing starts
- "Got it - what's next?" button

**Design Notes:**
- Don't overwhelm with details
- Just introduce the concept
- Show visual representation
- Smooth transition to next lesson topic
