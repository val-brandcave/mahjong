### Screen 5: Point Values & Scoring
**Text:**
```
Basic Scoring

Each hand on the card has a point value (25, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, etc.).

When you win:
• You collect that many points
• Other players pay you

How you win affects who pays:
• **Self-draw** (drew last tile yourself): All players pay you
• **Called discard** (called to win): Usually only discarder pays
  (Some groups play: everyone pays regardless)

Don't worry about complex scoring yet - focus on matching patterns!
```

---

### Screen 6: What If Multiple People Could Win?
**Text:**
```
Two People Could Win?

Sometimes two players could complete their hand with the same discard.

Rule: First person to shout "Mahjong!" wins!

Be quick when you have a winning hand!

If you draw your own winning tile (self-draw), only you can win.
```

```
What Happens After Mahjong?

1. Winner collects points (or money in some games)
