## Content Structure

### Screen 1: Introduction - The Optional Phases
**Text:**
```
Charleston Part 3

You've mastered the First Charleston (RAL - Right, Across, Left)!

In this lesson, you'll learn the OPTIONAL parts:
• Second Charleston (reversed direction)
• Courtesy Pass (final optional exchange)

These aren't required, but they're commonly used in games.

Let's learn them!
```

---

### Screen 2: Can We Stop Now?
**Text:**
```
Stopping After First Charleston

After completing the First Charleston, players can choose to STOP.

Any player can say "I'm good" or "Let's play" - if anyone wants to stop,
the Charleston ends there.

If ALL players want to continue, you do the Second Charleston.

It's perfectly fine to stop after the First Charleston!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Scenario practice: "Do you want to continue?" Yes/No voting
- Shows what happens if 1+ players say no (Charleston stops)
- Shows what happens if all say yes (Second Charleston begins)

---

### Screen 3: The Second Charleston - Reversed Direction
**Text:**
```
Second Charleston: The Reverse Pattern

If everyone agrees to continue, you do the Second Charleston.

It's the same three passes, but in REVERSE order:

First Charleston: RIGHT → ACROSS → LEFT (RAL)
Second Charleston: LEFT → ACROSS → RIGHT (LAR)

Memory trick: LAR is RAL backwards!
```

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison of First (RAL) and Second (LAR) Charleston

### Screen 4: Practice Second Charleston Pattern
**Interactive Simulation:**
- Pass Left (3 rounds)
- Pass Across (3 rounds)
- Pass Right (3 rounds)
- Total: 9 more passes

**Completion Message:**
"Excellent! You've completed the Second Charleston!"

### Screen 5: The Courtesy Pass
**Text:**
```
The Courtesy Pass (Optional)

After the Charleston (First or Second), there's one more optional pass:
the COURTESY PASS.

This is special:
• Pass ACROSS only
• Pass 0, 1, 2, OR 3 tiles (your choice!)
• One time only
• Completely optional

You can pass nothing if you don't want to!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Practice selecting 0-3 tiles
- See that 0 tiles is okay
- Animation showing across pass with variable number of tiles
