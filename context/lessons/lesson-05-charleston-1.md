## Lesson Overview

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON IN THE APP.** The Charleston is the #1 pain point for beginners - it's intimidating, confusing, and takes 30+ minutes to teach in person.

## Lesson Content Structure

### Screen 1: Introduction to the Charleston
**Visual:** Four players at table, each holding their organized rack, with emphasis on "before gameplay" message

**Text:**
```
The Charleston

You've heard this word - and maybe it sounds intimidating!

Don't worry. The Charleston is simply passing tiles with other players
BEFORE the game begins.

It seems complicated, but we're going to break it down into small,
simple steps.

You've got this!
```

**Narration Script (25 seconds):**
```
Let's talk about the Charleston. This is the part that intimidates most
beginners - and we totally understand why!

Here's the truth: The Charleston is just passing tiles back and forth with
other players before the game starts. That's it.

We're going to teach you one pass at a time, with lots of practice. By the
end, you'll wonder why you were ever worried!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Reassurance meter: "Confidence building..."
- "I'm ready to learn" button (but also "I'm nervous" option that provides extra encouragement)
- Optional: "Why is it called Charleston?" info button

**Design Notes:**

### Screen 2: What is the Charleston?
**Visual:** Timeline showing: Deal → Charleston → Actual Gameplay

**Text:**
```
What IS the Charleston?

After everyone receives their tiles, but BEFORE playing the game,
there's a phase called the Charleston.

During the Charleston, players pass tiles to each other.

Why? To get rid of tiles you don't want and hopefully get tiles you DO want!

It's like organizing and improving your hand before playing begins.
```

**Narration Script (25 seconds):**
```
Think of the Charleston as a preparation phase. You've just received 13 random
tiles. Some are helpful, some aren't.

The Charleston gives everyone a chance to exchange unwanted tiles with other
players. It's fair because everyone participates.

You'll pass tiles you don't want, and receive tiles from others. Hopefully,
you'll end up with a better starting hand!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Timeline animation showing game flow
- "When does it happen?" visual: Deal ✓ → Charleston ← YOU ARE HERE → Gameplay
- Compare to other games: "Like trading cards, but with specific rules"
- "That makes sense!" button

**Design Notes:**
- Clear timing: AFTER dealing, BEFORE playing
- Emphasize fairness (everyone does it)
- Use analogies (trading cards)
- Show it's a normal part of setup

**Text:**
```
The Full Charleston

The complete Charleston has THREE passes:

1️⃣ PASS RIGHT → (This lesson)
2️⃣ PASS ACROSS
3️⃣ PASS LEFT

Today, we'll focus on the first pass: PASS RIGHT.

Once you master this one pass, the others follow the same pattern!
```

**Narration Script (20 seconds):**
```
Before we dive in, here's the big picture: The Charleston has three passes.

Pass Right, Pass Across, and Pass Left. Each time, you select 3 tiles and pass
them to a specific player.

Don't worry - we're only learning PASS RIGHT today. Once you get this one
down, the other two are easy!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Visual diagram of all three passes (grayed out except RIGHT)
- "We're starting with PASS RIGHT" highlighted

### Screen 4: Pass Right - Visual Explanation
**Visual:** Overhead table view with clear arrows showing tiles passing from each player to their right

**Text:**
```
Pass Right

Here's how it works:

1. Look at your 13 tiles
2. Select 3 tiles you don't want
3. Pass those 3 tiles to the player on your RIGHT →
4. At the same time, receive 3 tiles from the player on your LEFT ←

All four players do this simultaneously!

Let's see it in action...
```

**Narration Script (25 seconds):**
```
Pass Right means exactly what it sounds like: pass tiles to the player on
your right.

You select 3 tiles from your rack that you don't want. Place them face-down
and push them to the player on your right.

At the exact same time, the player on your left is passing 3 tiles to YOU.

It's simultaneous - everyone passes at once!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Animated demonstration showing all 4 players passing right
- Color-coded arrows (gold player → red player → black player → blue player)
- Slow-motion option to see clearly
- Can replay animation
- "I see how it works!" button

**Visual Detail:**
- Clear RIGHT arrows (→) from each player
- Clear LEFT arrows (←) showing where tiles come from
- Emphasize simultaneity (all arrows move at once)
- First-person view option: "You are sitting here"

**Design Notes:**
- Make direction crystal clear
- Show it from overhead AND first-person perspective
- Emphasize "everyone at once"
- Use color coding consistently
- Repeat animation if needed

---

### Screen 5: Identifying Your Right & Left
**Visual:** First-person view from player's position at table

**Text:**
```
Who is on Your Right and Left?

This seems obvious, but let's make it clear!

If you're sitting at the East position:

👉 Your RIGHT: South
👈 Your LEFT: North

You'll pass TO South (right).
You'll receive FROM North (left).

Easy, right?
```

**Narration Script (20 seconds):**
```
Let's make sure you know who's on your right and left.

If you're sitting at East, South is on your right and North is on your left.
You'll pass tiles to South, and receive tiles from North.

The actual positions change depending on where you sit, but the concept is
always the same: pass to your right, receive from your left.
```

**Interactive Element:**
- First-person view with labeled positions
- Tap "WHO IS ON MY RIGHT?" → South lights up
- Tap "WHO IS ON MY LEFT?" → North lights up
- Practice from different seating positions
- "I've got this!" button

**Quiz:**
"If you're sitting at South, who is on your right?"
- A) East
- B) West ✓
- C) North
- D) Across

"If you're sitting at West, who is on your left?"
- A) South ✓
- B) North
- C) East
- D) Across

**Design Notes:**
- Make directions foolproof
- Allow practice from all 4 positions
- Visual confirmation of correct answers
- Eliminate any possible confusion

### Screen 6: Choosing Which Tiles to Pass
**Visual:** Player's rack showing 13 tiles with some tiles highlighted as "good to pass"

**Text:**
```
What Tiles Should You Pass?

Good question! Here are some tips:

✅ Pass single tiles with no pairs
✅ Pass tiles that don't fit patterns you're considering
✅ Pass tiles you have too many of
✅ Pass Flowers (they're bonus tiles - not needed for hands)

❌ Keep pairs and sets (tiles you have 2-3 of)
❌ Keep tiles that fit patterns on the card
❌ Keep Jokers (they're wild cards!)

Don't overthink it - just pass 3 tiles you don't think you'll use!
```

**Narration Script (30 seconds):**
```
Now, how do you choose which tiles to pass?

As a beginner, keep it simple: Pass tiles you don't think you'll use. Single
tiles with no matches are good candidates. If you have one 7 Dot and nothing
else with it, pass it!

Keep pairs - any tiles you have 2 or 3 of. These might become part of your
winning hand. And definitely keep Jokers - they're wild cards!

Don't stress about making the perfect choice. Even experienced players aren't
sure what's best early in the Charleston. Just pass 3 unwanted tiles!
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Example rack displayed
- User can tap tiles to see "Good to pass" or "Keep this"
- Multiple examples with different tile combinations
- "Show me an example" button for guided walkthrough
- "I'm ready to practice!" button

**Visual Examples:**

**Example 1: Pass Singles**
Rack: 1 Bam, 1 Bam, 7 Dot (single), Green Dragon (single), 4 Crak (single), 8 Bam (single), 2 Dot, 2 Dot, Joker, East Wind, East Wind, East Wind, 5 Crak

Suggest passing: 7 Dot, 4 Crak, 8 Bam (all singles with no pairs)

**Example 2: Keep Pairs**
Rack shows pairs of tiles highlighted in green
Singles highlighted in yellow as "consider passing"

**Design Notes:**
- Simple, beginner-friendly guidelines
- Don't overwhelm with advanced strategy
- Multiple examples build pattern recognition
- Emphasize: "Don't overthink it!"
- Positive reinforcement

### Screen 9: Charleston Etiquette & Tips
**Visual:** Four players at table with thought bubbles showing dos and don'ts

**Text:**
```
Charleston Etiquette

A few important rules:

✅ Pass tiles FACE-DOWN (keep them secret)
✅ All players pass at the same time
✅ Wait for everyone to be ready before passing
✅ No talking about what you're passing or what you want
✅ You MUST pass exactly 3 tiles

❌ Don't look at tiles before everyone is ready
❌ Don't pass fewer or more than 3 tiles
❌ Don't announce what you're passing

These rules keep the Charleston fair for everyone!
```

**Narration Script (25 seconds):**
```
Before we finish, let's cover Charleston etiquette.

Always pass tiles face-down so others can't see them. Everyone passes
simultaneously - wait until all players are ready. And you must always pass
exactly 3 tiles.

Don't talk about what you're passing or what you hope to get. Keep the
Charleston fair and secret!

These rules might seem strict, but they ensure everyone has an equal chance.
```

**Interactive Element:**
- Scenarios showing correct and incorrect behavior
- "What's wrong with this?" quiz
