## Topics Covered

### 1. What is the NML Card?
- Shows ALL valid winning hand patterns
- Released annually by National Mahjong League (changes every April)
- All players must use the same year's card
- Physical card or digital version
- Essential for playing - you cannot win without matching a card pattern

### 2. Card Sections
- **2024:** (Year displayed at top)
- **Singles & Pairs**
- **Consecutive Runs**
- **Quints** (5 of a kind)
- **3-369** (specific number patterns)
- **Winds & Dragons**
- **Year Hands** (special hands for the year)
- Each section has multiple lines/patterns

### 3. Reading a Line
- Each line = one valid winning hand
- Symbols represent tiles:
  - **FF** = Flowers (any 2)
  - **1111** = Four 1s (any suit)
  - **DDD** = Three Dragons (any combination)
  - **DDDD** = Four Dragons (any combination)
  - **NNNN** = Four matching numbers
  - **NNN** = Three matching numbers
- Numbers can be any suit unless specified

### 4. Concealed vs. Exposed
- **C** = Concealed (tiles stay hidden in your rack)
- **X** = Exposed (tiles revealed to other players)
- **No letter** = Can be either concealed or exposed
- Concealed hands usually worth more points

### 5. Point Values
- Numbers on left of each line show points
- Higher points = harder hands
- Beginners should aim for lower-point hands (easier)
- Points determine who pays winner and how much

### 6. Choosing a Hand
- After Charleston, look at your tiles
- Find patterns on card that match tiles you have
- Choose 1-2 possible hands to pursue
- Stay flexible early - commit to one hand as you get closer

## Content Structure

### Screen 1: Introduction to the Card
**Text:**
```
The National Mahjong League Card

This card is the most important tool in Mahjong!

It shows every valid winning hand pattern. To win, your 14 tiles must match
one of the patterns on this card.

The card changes every year in April, keeping the game fresh and challenging.

Let's learn how to read it!
```

**Visual:** Beautiful image of physical NML card
**Interactive:** Zoom and explore card sections

### Screen 2: Card Organization - Sections
**Text:**
```
The Card is Organized into Sections

Each section contains similar types of hands:

• Singles & Pairs: Hands with pairs of tiles
• Consecutive Runs: Sequential numbers (like 1-2-3 or 4-5-6)
• Quints: Five matching tiles
• 3-369: Hands using 3s, 6s, and 9s
• Winds & Dragons: Honor tile hands
• Year Hands: Special patterns for 2024

Each section has multiple "lines" - each line is one winning hand.
```

**Visual:** Card with sections highlighted in different colors
**Interactive:** Tap each section to see example hands

---

### Screen 3: Reading a Line - Example 1
**Text:**
```
How to Read a Line

Let's look at a simple example:

FF 1111 2222 3333

This means:
• FF = Two Flowers (any Flowers)
• 1111 = Four 1s in any suit (1 Bam, 1 Crak, 1 Dot, 1 of another suit)
• 2222 = Four 2s in any suit
• 3333 = Four 3s in any suit

Total: 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14 tiles (a winning hand!)
```

**Visual:** Line from card with tiles shown below matching pattern
**Interactive:** User matches tiles to pattern

---

### Screen 4: Concealed vs. Exposed
**Text:**
```
Understanding C and X

Some lines have letters:

**Example:** FF DDDD 2222 X 3333 C

• **X** (Exposed): 2222 X means these four 2s must be exposed to other players
• **C** (Concealed): 3333 C means these four 3s must stay hidden in your rack
• **No letter**: FF and DDDD can be either concealed or exposed

Concealed hands are usually worth more points because they're harder!
```

**Visual:** Split screen showing concealed rack vs. exposed tiles on table
**Interactive:** Practice identifying C, X, or neither

---

### Screen 5: Point Values
**Text:**
```
Point Values

Each line has a number on the left showing its point value:

25 points = Easier hand
50 points = Medium difficulty
75+ points = Harder hand

Beginners should aim for 25-30 point hands - they're simpler patterns!

Points determine payouts when you win (we'll cover that in Lesson 10).
```

**Visual:** Card section with point values highlighted
**Interactive:** Sort hands by point value (easy → hard)

---

### Screen 6: Common Symbols Guide
**Text:**
```
Symbol Quick Reference

• **FF** = Two Flowers
• **FFF** = Three Flowers
• **FFFF** = Four Flowers
• **DD** / **DDD** / **DDDD** = Dragons (any color)
• **DDDD** (with colors) = Specific Dragons
• **NEWS** or Wind symbols = Wind tiles
• **1111** = Four 1s in any suit
• **NNN** or **NNNN** = Matching numbers (like 555 or 8888)
• **Like tiles** = Numbers in same suit
• **Any suit** = Numbers from any suit

Don't memorize this - you'll learn as you play!
```

**Visual:** Reference chart always accessible

---

### Screen 7: Practice Reading Lines

**Exercise:** Show 5 different lines, user interprets them

**Example 1:**
Line: `FF 2222 3333 DD DD`

Question: "How many 2s do you need?"
Answer: 4 (any suit)

**Example 2:**
Line: `1111 DDD C NNN X`

Question: "Which tiles must be concealed?"
Answer: The three matching numbers (NNN C)

**Example 3:**
Line: `FF 11 22 33 44 55 66`

Question: "Are these consecutive runs?"
Answer: Yes, pairs of consecutive numbers

### Screen 8: Choosing a Hand for Your Tiles

**Text:**
```
Choosing Your Hand

After the Charleston, you have 13 tiles. Here's how to choose:

1. Look at your tiles - do you have pairs? Sets of 3-4?
2. Scan the card for patterns that match what you have
3. Consider 2-3 possible hands initially
4. As you draw/discard, commit to ONE hand

Don't choose immediately - stay flexible!
```

**Interactive Practice:**
- Given: A sample rack of 13 tiles
- User explores card to find 2-3 possible matching hands
- System highlights potential matches
- Discussion of which is most realistic

**Example:**
Tiles: 1 Bam, 1 Bam, 2 Bam, 2 Bam, 3 Bam, 3 Bam, Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Green Dragon, Joker, Joker, East Wind, 7 Dot

Possible hands:
- Consecutive Run pattern (using Bams)
- Dragon pattern (if can get more Dragons)

---

### Screen 9: Practice Matching Tiles to Card
**Interactive Exercise:**

Show 3 scenarios:
1. Rack of tiles → Find matching line on card
2. Line on card → Select tiles that would complete it
3. Partial hand → Identify what tiles are still needed

Build confidence in reading card and applying to tiles.
