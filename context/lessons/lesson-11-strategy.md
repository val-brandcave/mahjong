## Topics Covered

### 1. Evaluating Your Tiles
- Count what you have (pairs, sets of 3-4, singles)
- Look for patterns (consecutive numbers, matching suits)
- Identify Jokers and how many you have
- Note Dragons and Winds
- Consider Flowers

### 2. Finding Possible Hands
- Scan card sections that match your tiles
- Identify 2-3 possible hands initially
- Compare difficulty (how many tiles do you need?)
- Consider point values (risk vs. reward)

### 3. Staying Flexible
- Don't commit to one hand immediately
- Keep options open early in the game
- Draw and discard to improve options
- Watch what tiles are being discarded

### 4. When to Commit
- Halfway through game, narrow to 1-2 hands
- Commit when you're 3-4 tiles away
- Once committed, discard tiles for other hands
- Stay focused on your chosen pattern

### 5. When to Pivot
- Your tiles aren't coming (tiles you need are dead/discarded)
- You're not getting closer
- Another hand becomes more realistic
- Better to pivot early than late

### 6. Reading Opponents' Discards
- What tiles are being thrown?
- What patterns might opponents be playing?
- Are your needed tiles still available?
- Adjust strategy based on discards

### Screen 2: Evaluating Your Tiles After Charleston
**Text:**
```
What Do You Have?

After Charleston, take stock:

✓ Count pairs (2 matching tiles)
✓ Count sets (3-4 matching tiles)
✓ Note singles (1 tile with no match)
✓ Count Jokers (wild cards!)
✓ Look for consecutive numbers (1-2-3, 4-5-6, etc.)
✓ Note Dragons and Winds

Example:
2Bam, 2Bam, 3Bam, 3Bam, 4Bam, 5Bam, Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Red Dragon,
Joker, Joker, 7Dot, East Wind

Analysis:
• Pairs: 2 Bam, 3 Bam
• Set: Red Dragon (3)
• Consecutive: 2-3-4-5 Bam (some pairs, some singles)
• Jokers: 2
• Singles: 7Dot, East Wind
```

**Interactive:** Practice evaluating 5 different hands

---

### Screen 3: Finding Hands on the Card
**Text:**
```
Match Your Tiles to Card Patterns

Now scan the card for hands that match what you have:

Given example above:
• Consecutive Run section (you have 2-3-4-5 Bam)
• Dragon section (you have 3 Red Dragons)
• Mixed hands using Dragons + numbers

Identify 2-3 possible hands initially!

Don't worry about perfection - you'll develop "Mahjong eye" with practice.
```

**Interactive:** Given tiles, user finds 2-3 matching hands on card

---

### Screen 4: Comparing Options
**Text:**
```
Which Hand Should You Choose?

Consider these factors:

1. **How close are you?**
   - Need 2 tiles? Very doable!
   - Need 6+ tiles? Might be too hard

2. **Are tiles available?**
   - Look at discards - are your needed tiles gone?
   - If yes, choose different hand

3. **Point value**
   - Higher points = harder but more reward
   - Lower points = easier but less reward
   - Beginners: Choose easier hands (25-40 points)

4. **Jokers**
   - Jokers can substitute for most tiles
   - More Jokers = more flexibility
```

---

### Screen 5: Staying Flexible Early
**Text:**
```
Don't Commit Too Soon!

In the first few turns:
✓ Keep 2-3 possible hands in mind
✓ Draw and discard to see what comes
✓ Watch other players' discards
✓ Stay open to changing hands

❌ Don't lock into one hand immediately
❌ Don't discard tiles that work for multiple hands
❌ Don't ignore what's happening on table

Flexibility = More chances to win!
```

**Interactive Scenario:** Play several turns while keeping options open

---

### Screen 6: When to Commit to One Hand
**Text:**
```
Committing to Your Hand

Around halfway through the game (or when you're close), commit to ONE hand:

Signs you should commit:
• You're 3-4 tiles away from completing
• You have Jokers to fill gaps
• Needed tiles are still available
• Drawing tiles that fit this hand

Once committed:
• Discard ALL tiles that don't fit
• Focus only on this pattern
• Use Jokers strategically
• Push toward completion

Timing matters - commit too early or too late and you might lose!
```

---

### Screen 7: Recognizing When to Pivot
**Text:**
```
When to Change Hands

Sometimes you must abandon your hand and choose a different one:

Pivot when:
❌ Tiles you need have been discarded (dead tiles)
❌ Not getting closer after 5-6 turns
❌ Another hand becomes more realistic
❌ You're far from completion and time is running out

How to pivot:
1. Quickly scan card for new options
2. Choose hand that matches current tiles
3. Discard tiles for old hand
4. Commit to new direction

Better to pivot early than stick with impossible hand!
```

**Interactive Scenarios:**
- Scenario 1: Needed tiles are dead - must pivot
- Scenario 2: Drawing tiles for different hand - should pivot
- Scenario 3: Close to completion - don't pivot!

---

### Screen 8: Reading the Table
**Text:**
```
Pay Attention to Discards

Watch what others are throwing:

✓ Many 1s discarded? Hands using 1s might be hard
✓ No Dragons discarded? Someone might be collecting them
✓ Lots of Winds? Probably safe to discard Winds

This helps you:
• Know if your tiles are available
• Guess what opponents might be playing
• Make smarter discard choices
• Decide whether to pivot

Don't just focus on your rack - watch the table!
```

---

### Screen 9: Strategic Decision Practice

**Interactive Exercise:**
Multiple scenarios where user must make strategic decisions:

**Scenario 1: Which Hand?**
Given tiles after Charleston, choose best hand from 3 options
System analyzes choice and explains pros/cons

**Scenario 2: Stay or Pivot?**
Midgame situation - should you continue current hand or pivot?
System provides reasoning

**Scenario 3: What to Discard?**
You're keeping options open - which tile should you discard?
System shows how each discard affects your options

**Scenario 4: Time to Commit?**
Are you close enough to commit to one hand?
System evaluates your position

---
