### Screen 2: Pung - Three Identical Tiles
**Text:**
```
What is a Pung?

A Pung is a set of three identical tiles.

Example: 5 Bam, 5 Bam, 5 Bam

**When to declare Pung:**
• Your hand requires a set of three identical tiles
• Someone discards the tile you need
• You already have two of that tile

**How to declare:**
1. Shout "Pung!" (or just "Call!")
2. Take the discarded tile
3. Expose all three tiles face-up
4. Discard a different tile

Note: Most hands with "NNN" on the card can use Pungs.
```

**Interactive:** Practice Pung scenarios

---

### Screen 3: Kong - Four Identical Tiles
**Text:**
```
What is a Kong?

A Kong is a set of four identical tiles.

Example: Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Red Dragon

**Two types of Kongs:**

**1. Exposed Kong:**
• Someone discards the tile you need
• You have three already
• Declare "Kong!"
• Expose all four tiles
• Draw a replacement tile from end of wall

**2. Concealed Kong:**
• You draw the fourth tile yourself
• Keep all four in your rack (concealed)
• No need to declare unless winning
• Some hands require concealed Kongs (marked with C)

Kongs are less common - don't worry if you don't use them often!
```

---

### Screen 4: Flowers - Bonus Tiles
**Text:**
```
Using Flower Tiles

Flowers are special bonus tiles:

**When you draw a Flower:**
• Set it aside face-up in front of you
• Draw replacement tile from end of wall
• Continue your turn

**Scoring:**
• Each Flower = small bonus points
• Some hands specifically require Flowers (FF, FFF, FFFF on card)
• Flowers don't count toward your 14 tiles for most hands

**In beginner games:**
• Often ignored or used just for bonus points
• Don't worry too much about Flowers initially!
```

---

### Screen 5: Edge Case - Multiple Calls
**Text:**
```
What If Two People Call the Same Tile?

Sometimes two players want the same discard!

**Priority Rules:**

1. **Mahjong (winning) always wins**
   • If someone calls to win, they get the tile
   • Beats all other calls

2. **Otherwise: Closest player in turn order wins**
   • Usually next player in rotation
   • Or: player who called first (group decides)

**Example:**
• East discards 5 Dot
• South calls to win (Mahjong!) - South gets tile ✓
• West and North both called for Pung - too late

**Clear before playing:** Make sure your group agrees on priority rules!
```

---

### Screen 6: Edge Case - Miscounting Tiles
**Text:**
```
Oops! Wrong Number of Tiles

You have 15 tiles instead of 14? Or only 12?

**Dead Hand Rule:**
• Too many or too few tiles = Dead hand
• You cannot win this game
• Continue playing to avoid disrupting others
• Learn from mistake for next game!

**Prevention:**
• Count tiles carefully after Charleston
• Count before exposing (calling)
• Double-check before declaring Mahjong

**If caught during game:**
• Announce: "I'm dead" (optional, but courteous)
• Other players continue normally
```

---

### Screen 7: Edge Case - Disputed Wins
**Text:**
```
Resolving Win Disputes

Someone declares Mahjong but hand doesn't match card?

**Resolution Steps:**
1. All players examine the tiles
2. Check card pattern carefully
3. Verify concealed/exposed requirements met
4. Count tiles (must be exactly 14)

**If hand is INVALID:**
• Win is denied
• Player may be declared dead (depends on group rules)
• Game continues with other players

**If hand is VALID but not obvious:**
• Show clearly which line on card
• Explain pattern matching
• Other players verify

**Tip:** Always be 100% sure before declaring Mahjong!
```

### Screen 8: Tournament & League Play
**Text:**
```
Competitive Play Differences

**Tournament Rules:**
• Official NML rules strictly enforced
• Time limits per game (e.g., 15 minutes)
• Points carefully tracked
• Specific penalty rules for errors
• No "take-backs" allowed
• East rotation rules strictly followed

**League Play:**
• Season-long scoring
• Standings and rankings
• Championship tournaments
• May use handicap systems
• Social aspects important too!

**Casual Play:**
• More relaxed rules
• Often allow take-backs for beginners
• Less emphasis on speed
• Focus on learning and fun

Know which context you're playing in!
```

### Screen 9: Common House Rules
**Text:**
```
Optional Rule Variations

Different groups play with different house rules:

**Examples:**
• **"Hot wall":** Drawing from different spots
• **Joker-less play:** Some groups don't use Jokers
• **No Second Charleston:** Only play First Charleston
• **Doubling point values:** For special situations
• **Flower bonuses:** Different point values
• **Payment methods:** Who pays winner varies

**Before playing with a new group:**
✓ Ask about house rules
✓ Clarify Charleston (First only? Second? Courtesy?)
✓ Confirm Pung/Kong rules
✓ Understand payment structure
✓ Know penalty rules

Most groups are happy to explain their preferences!
