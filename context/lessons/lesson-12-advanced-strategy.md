### Screen 1: Introduction to Advanced Strategy
**Text:**
```
Playing Like a Pro

You know basic strategy - now let's level up!

Advanced players don't just focus on their own hand:
• They read opponents' hands
• They play defensively to prevent others from winning
• They make strategic discards
• They manage Jokers expertly

### Screen 2: Reading Opponents' Hands
**Text:**
```
What Are They Playing?

Watch exposed tiles to guess opponents' hands:

Example:
Opponent exposed: 1111 (four 1s)

Look at card sections with 1111:
• They might be playing consecutive (1111 2222 3333)
• Or a specific pattern with four 1s

Now you know:
❌ Don't discard 2s or 3s (might help them)
✓ Safe to discard 7s, 8s, 9s (probably don't help)

Reading opponents = Better defense!
```

**Interactive:** Show exposed tiles, user identifies possible hands

---

### Screen 3: Defensive Discarding
**Text:**
```
Safe vs. Dangerous Discards

**Safe discards:**
• Tiles already discarded by multiple players
• Tiles far from patterns opponents are playing
• Tiles you've seen exposed (they already have them)

**Dangerous discards:**
• Tiles that complete common patterns
• Tiles similar to what opponents called
• Tiles in range of their exposed sets

When someone seems close to winning, play defensively!
```

**Interactive Scenarios:**
- Given opponent's exposed tiles and discards
- User chooses safest discard from 3 options
- System explains why choice was safe/dangerous

---

### Screen 4: "Playing Dirty" - Strategic Holding
**Text:**
```
Strategic Tile Control

Advanced tactic: Hold tiles opponents need!

Example:
• Opponent exposed: DDD (three Dragons)
• Card shows: DDD FFFF 1111 2222
• They need: Flowers, 1s, and 2s

Strategy:
✓ Hold any Flowers, 1s, or 2s you have
✓ Discard tiles they don't need
✓ Even if you don't need those tiles, keep them to slow opponent

This is legal and smart! It's called "playing dirty" but it's just good strategy.
```

---

### Screen 5: Joker Management
**Text:**
```
Advanced Joker Strategy

**Use Jokers immediately when:**
• You're very close to winning (1-2 tiles away)
• You need to expose and Joker completes the set
• Joker makes you flexible for multiple hands

**Save Jokers for later when:**
• You have multiple possible hands
• Still early in game
• You're not sure which hand you'll pursue
• Want maximum flexibility

**Multiple Jokers:**
• 2 Jokers = Save at least one for endgame
• 3+ Jokers = Use some now, save some for later

Jokers are powerful - use them wisely!
```

**Interactive Scenarios:**
Given hand and Jokers, decide when to use them

---

### Screen 6: Risk vs. Reward
**Text:**
```
High Risk or Safe Play?

Every game presents choices:

**High-Point Hand (Risky):**
• Harder to complete (need specific tiles)
• More points if you win
• Takes longer
• Might not complete at all

**Low-Point Hand (Safe):**
• Easier to complete
• Fewer points if you win
• Faster
• More likely to finish

Strategy: Consider game context!
• Behind in score? Go for high points!
• Leading in score? Play it safe!
• Tournament final? Risk might be worth it!
• Casual game? Play for fun!
```

---

### Screen 7: Recognizing When Someone is Close
**Text:**
```
Is Someone About to Win?

Signs someone is close:
• They've exposed multiple sets
• They're hesitating before discards (being careful)
• They're not calling tiles (concealed hand)
• They're discarding quickly (don't need anything else)

When you suspect someone is close:
✓ Play defensively (safe discards only)
✓ Don't call tiles unless winning
✓ Hold tiles that might complete their hand
✓ Speed up your own progress if possible

Awareness prevents giving away wins!
```

---

### Screen 8: Tournament vs. Casual Strategy
**Text:**
```
Different Contexts, Different Strategies

**Casual Play:**
• Focus on having fun
• Experiment with different hands
• Less defensive play needed
• Speed less important

**Tournament/League Play:**
• Points matter - track carefully
• Defensive play crucial
• Speed matters (faster players do better)
• Conservative strategies reduce risk
• Every decision counts

Adjust your strategy to the context!
```
